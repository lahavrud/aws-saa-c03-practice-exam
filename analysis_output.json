The core requirement is to choose the right AWS services for these two distinct security tasks: threat detection in S3 and vulnerability assessments on EC2.",
      "correct_explanation": "Option 2 is correct because it uses Amazon GuardDuty to monitor malicious activity on data stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon Inspector to check for vulnerabilities on Amazon EC2 instances. GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3.

Although the assets would be accessed occasionally after the first week, but they must continue to be immediately accessible when required. The cost of maintaining all the assets on Amazon S3 storage is turning out to be very expensive and the agency is looking at reducing costs as much as possible.

The agency needs to reduce storage costs while ensuring immediate accessibility when needed. The key is to use S3 lifecycle policies to transition data to a cheaper storage class after the initial high-access period.",
      "correct_explanation": "Option 3 is correct because it configures a lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days. S3 One Zone-IA offers a lower storage cost compared to S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA. While the question states high access for the first few days and reduced access after a week, transitioning after 30 days still addresses the requirement of cost reduction while maintaining immediate accessibility. S3 One Zone-IA is suitable because the assets are re-creatable, mitigating the risk of data loss in a single availability zone. The infrequent access requirement is also met.",
      "incorrect_explanations": {
        "0": "Option 0 is incorrect because transitioning after only 7 days might be too soon. The question states high access for the first few days, but it doesn't explicitly state that access drops to almost zero immediately after a week. Transitioning after 7 days might result in unnecessary transitions if there's still some level of frequent access between 7 and 30 days. Also, while S3 One Zone-IA is a good choice, the timing is premature.",

The question is asking for the BEST solution, implying there might be multiple viable options, but one is superior given the specific constraints.",
      "correct_explanation": "Option 1, using Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS), is the best solution. SSE-KMS allows S3 to encrypt the data using keys managed by KMS. This fulfills the requirement of encrypting data at rest in S3. Importantly, KMS provides a full audit trail via AWS CloudTrail, showing when the key was used, by whom, and from which IP address. This satisfies the audit requirement.

The core requirement is to choose a solution that can handle frequent updates and reads with minimal delay, making in-memory data stores a suitable choice.",
      "correct_explanation": "Option 1 is correct because Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is an in-memory data store specifically designed for low-latency read and write operations. It offers high availability through replication and automatic failover. Redis's data structures are well-suited for leaderboard implementations, allowing for efficient ranking and retrieval of user data.

DAX is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB. It significantly improves read performance by caching frequently accessed data, reducing the load on DynamoDB and lowering latency. Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches static content like images from S3 at edge locations globally.

Specifically, the question focuses on transitions *to* and *from* Intelligent-Tiering, Standard-IA, and One Zone-IA.",
      "correct_explanation": "Options 1 and 3 are the correct answers because they represent invalid lifecycle transitions in Amazon S3. \n\n*   **Option 1: Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering => Amazon S3 Standard:** This transition is invalid. Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves objects between frequent, infrequent, and archive access tiers based on access patterns. You cannot directly transition an object *from* Intelligent-Tiering *to* Standard. Intelligent-Tiering manages the tiering automatically. To move an object to Standard, you would need to copy the object to a new object in the Standard storage class. \n\n*   **Option 3: Amazon S3 One Zone-IA => Amazon S3 Standard-IA:** This transition is invalid. One Zone-IA stores data in a single Availability Zone, making it cheaper but less resilient than Standard-IA, which stores data in multiple Availability Zones. You cannot directly transition from One Zone-IA to Standard-IA. To achieve this, you would need to copy the object to a new object in the Standard-IA storage class. The key reason is the difference in data redundancy and availability guarantees. One Zone-IA is designed for data that can tolerate loss of availability in a single AZ, whereas Standard-IA is designed for higher availability with multi-AZ redundancy.",

A solutions architect has been asked to redesign the backend for scalability and cost-efficiency, without reengineering the database layer.

The goal is to redesign the backend for scalability and cost-efficiency without modifying the database layer. The core problem is the EC2 instances are overwhelmed during peak times, leading to application timeouts. The solution needs to address this bottleneck in a scalable and cost-effective way.",
      "correct_explanation": "Options 2 and 3 are the correct answers.\n\n*   **Option 2: Implement Amazon RDS Proxy between the application and the Aurora PostgreSQL cluster. Deploy EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to retry transactions as needed.** RDS Proxy helps manage database connections, reducing the overhead on the Aurora database. It pools and reuses database connections, preventing connection exhaustion during peak loads. Deploying EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group ensures that the application can scale horizontally to handle increased traffic. Retrying transactions handles transient failures effectively. This combination addresses scalability and resilience without requiring database changes.\n\n*   **Option 3: Modify the application to publish purchase events to an Amazon SQS queue. Launch an Auto Scaling group of EC2 workers that poll the queue and process purchases asynchronously.** This implements an asynchronous processing pattern. Instead of directly processing purchases synchronously, the application publishes purchase events to an SQS queue. An Auto Scaling group of EC2 workers then consumes these events and processes the purchases in the background. This decouples the front-end application from the back-end processing, allowing the front-end to remain responsive even during peak loads. SQS provides buffering and ensures that no purchase events are lost. The Auto Scaling group scales the processing capacity based on the queue length, providing scalability and cost-efficiency.",

The primary requirement is secure and appropriate DNS resolution. The key is to understand how Route 53 can be configured to forward DNS queries to on-premises DNS servers.",
      "correct_explanation": "Option 1 is the correct answer because it utilizes Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints and forwarding rules. An outbound endpoint allows DNS queries originating from the VPC to be forwarded to on-premises DNS servers. The forwarding rule specifies which domain names (e.g., *.internal.example.com) should be routed to the on-premises DNS servers. This approach is secure because it only forwards specific queries to the on-premises DNS servers, rather than exposing the entire VPC's DNS resolution to the on-premises environment. Associating the rule with the VPC ensures that only resources within that VPC can use the rule.",

The application in AWS needs to resolve on-premises DNS records, not the other way around. Enabling recursive DNS resolution in the VPC is not sufficient on its own to resolve on-premises records.",
        "2": "Option 2 is incorrect because creating a Route 53 private hosted zone for the on-premises domain would require manually replicating the DNS records from the on-premises DNS servers into the Route 53 hosted zone. This is not a dynamic solution and would require constant synchronization, making it impractical and error-prone. The question implies the need for dynamic resolution of on-premises DNS records.",

It identifies potential compatibility issues and provides recommendations for resolving them. AWS DMS then migrates the data from the source SQL Server database to the target Aurora PostgreSQL database.

The scenario highlights the need for a service that can intelligently route traffic to healthy regions and handle UDP traffic efficiently.",

It uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the nearest healthy endpoint based on network conditions and health checks. Global Accelerator supports UDP, which is crucial for the gaming application. Furthermore, it allows for fast regional failover, typically within seconds, by automatically redirecting traffic to a healthy region if one becomes unavailable.

It's designed specifically for this type of scenario and is generally cost-effective for large file transfers.\n\n*   **Option 3: Use multipart uploads for faster file uploads into the destination Amazon S3 bucket:** Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part can be uploaded independently, and in parallel. This can significantly improve upload speed, especially over unreliable networks, as individual parts can be retried without re-uploading the entire file. It also allows for uploading large files that exceed the single object size limit. It is a built-in S3 feature and doesn't incur additional costs beyond standard S3 storage and request charges. It also improves resilience to network interruptions.",

The solution needs to distribute the load across S3 to avoid this bottleneck.",
      "correct_explanation": "Option 1 is the correct answer. S3 automatically partitions data to scale and handle high request rates. However, if object keys are sequentially named (e.g., using timestamps or sequential IDs), all requests might be directed to a single partition, leading to throttling. Using customer-specific prefixes distributes the load across multiple partitions within the same bucket, effectively increasing the aggregate request rate the service can handle. This approach is resource-efficient because it avoids creating a large number of buckets, which can add management overhead and potentially increase costs.

This aligns with operational excellence and reliability pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.\n*   **Option 2:** By default, Lambda functions do not have access to resources within a VPC. When a Lambda function is configured to access resources within a VPC (e.g., a database), it needs to be associated with subnets within that VPC. To access public internet resources or public AWS APIs from within the VPC, the Lambda function needs a route through a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance in a public subnet.

The key requirements are ordered processing per desktop and scalability to handle a large number of desktops.",

The requirement to withstand server failures further points towards using a Spot Fleet, which provides automatic replacement of interrupted instances.",
      "correct_explanation": "Option 1, 'Run the workload on a Spot Fleet,' is the most cost-optimal solution. Spot Fleets allow you to request multiple Spot Instances across different instance types and Availability Zones. This provides flexibility in terms of instance sizes and helps to minimize the risk of interruption. If a Spot Instance is terminated due to price fluctuations, the Spot Fleet will automatically attempt to replace it with another instance that meets your criteria. This ensures the workload can continue to run even if some instances are interrupted.

    "question_text": "A multinational logistics company is migrating its core systems to AWS. As part of this migration, the company has built an Amazon S3–based data lake to ingest and analyze supply chain data from external carriers and vendors. While some vendors have adopted the company’s modern REST-based APIs for S3 uploads, others operate legacy systems that rely exclusively on SFTP for file transfers. These vendors are unable or unwilling to modify their workflows to support S3 APIs. The company wants to provide these vendors with an SFTP-compatible solution that allows direct uploads to Amazon S3, and must use fully managed AWS services to avoid managing any infrastructure. It must also support identity federation so that internal teams can map vendor access securely to specific S3 buckets or prefixes. Which combination of options will provide a scalable and low-maintenance solution for this use case? (Select two)",

The company requires a fully managed, scalable, and low-maintenance solution for SFTP uploads directly to S3, with identity federation for secure access control. The solution must avoid managing infrastructure and support mapping vendor access to specific S3 buckets or prefixes.",
      "correct_explanation": "Options 0 and 1 together provide the best solution. Option 0 leverages AWS Transfer Family with SFTP enabled to provide a fully managed SFTP endpoint. Configuring it to store uploaded files directly in an S3 bucket eliminates the need for custom infrastructure. Setting up IAM roles mapped to each vendor allows for secure bucket or prefix access, fulfilling the requirement for fine-grained permissions. Option 1 complements this by configuring S3 bucket policies to use IAM role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized vendors can access specific S3 locations. Integrating Transfer Family with an identity provider (Cognito or a custom provider) allows for federation, enabling internal teams to manage vendor access securely and map it to specific S3 buckets or prefixes. This combination provides a secure, scalable, and low-maintenance solution that meets all the requirements.",

        "2": "Option 2 suggests using Amazon AppFlow. While AppFlow can move data to S3, it's primarily designed for data integration from SaaS applications, not for acting as an SFTP server. It also introduces complexity with scheduling and transformation, which are not necessary given the Transfer Family solution. The requirement is for direct uploads, not extraction and transformation.",
        "3": "Option 3 suggests using Route 53 private hosted zones for vendor-specific subdomains. While this adds a layer of organization, it doesn't directly address the core requirements of secure file transfer and identity federation. Route 53 is for DNS management, not access control or file transfer. It also doesn't contribute to the fully managed aspect of the solution.",
        "4": "Option 4 suggests using an EC2 instance with a custom SFTP server. This violates the requirement for a fully managed solution, as it involves managing the EC2 instance, operating system, SFTP server software, and cron jobs. It also adds operational overhead and complexity, making it a less desirable option compared to AWS Transfer Family."

SNS is primarily designed for fan-out messaging, where a single message is delivered to multiple subscribers. While the application could subscribe to the SNS topic, polling SNS is not a standard or efficient practice. SNS doesn't inherently provide buffering or guaranteed delivery in the same way SQS does, potentially leading to data loss during surges. Also, managing subscriptions and filtering messages in SNS can add operational complexity.",

CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN), caches these assets at edge locations globally, reducing latency for users and offloading traffic from the origin server (S3).

Lambda is a serverless compute service, but using it with RDS to serve static assets is an overly complex and expensive solution. RDS is a relational database service, designed for structured data, not for storing and serving static files. While Lambda can serve static content, it's not optimized for this purpose, and using RDS as the data source adds unnecessary overhead and cost. This approach also requires more configuration and management than using S3 and CloudFront.",

While DynamoDB Streams captures item-level changes, restoring the table using streams would involve replaying the stream events in reverse order to undo the corrupted writes. This is a complex and time-consuming process, especially if the corruption involves multiple writes or complex data transformations.

This is a crucial security feature for protecting sensitive information.\n*   **Option 3 (Amazon CloudFront can route to multiple origins based on the content type):** CloudFront can be configured to route requests to different origins based on various factors, including content type. This is achieved through behaviors and path patterns. For example, requests for images (.jpg, .png) can be routed to an S3 bucket optimized for image storage, while requests for dynamic content (.php, .jsp) can be routed to an EC2 instance or an Application Load Balancer.\n*   **Option 5 (Use an origin group with primary and secondary origins to configure Amazon CloudFront for high-availability and failover):** Origin groups provide high availability and failover capabilities.

A crucial detail is that cross-zone load balancing is disabled on the NLBs. This means each NLB only distributes traffic to targets within its own AZ. Route 53 uses a weighted routing policy (implicitly, since it's distributing across NLBs) to send traffic to each NLB. Since the question doesn't specify any weights, we can assume equal weighting to each NLB. Therefore, each NLB receives 50% of the traffic. The question then asks about the traffic distribution *within* AZ-A, which has four targets.",

The scenario states that the io1 volume is underutilized but experiences occasional I/O bursts. gp2 volumes provide a good balance of price and performance for most workloads and offer the ability to burst to higher IOPS for short periods. Since the current io1 volume is underutilized, switching to gp2 will likely reduce costs significantly without negatively impacting performance, especially considering the occasional burst pattern. gp2 volumes are also suitable for boot volumes and general-purpose workloads, making them a good fit for this scenario.",

The question tests the understanding of CIDR notation and how it's used in S3 bucket policies to control access based on IP addresses.",

EFS is designed to be accessed from instances within the same AZ as its mount target. Accessing EFS across AZs introduces latency due to inter-AZ network traffic. By ensuring each EC2 instance accesses an EFS mount target within its own AZ, the solution minimizes the network distance and therefore the latency for file system operations. This approach leverages EFS's distributed architecture to provide optimal performance for the HPC workload.",

Also, S3 is eventually consistent, which is not suitable for HPC workloads requiring strong consistency.",
        "1": "Option 1 is incorrect because creating a single EFS mount target in one AZ and allowing all EC2 instances in other AZs to access it introduces significant cross-AZ network latency.

The cross-AZ traffic will negatively impact the overall performance of the HPC workload, violating the primary requirement of minimizing latency.",

This eliminates the need to create separate IAM users in each AWS account or manage a separate identity store.

The key requirements are scalability, reliability (no job loss), and accommodation of fluctuating demand in both stages.",

The question is testing the understanding of S3 Object Lock and its different modes, specifically Compliance and Governance modes, and their implications on data immutability.",
      "correct_explanation": "Option 0 is correct because S3 Object Lock in Compliance Mode is designed to enforce retention policies strictly. Once an object is locked in Compliance Mode, the retention settings cannot be changed, and the object cannot be deleted by any user, including the root user or administrators, during the specified retention period. This mode provides the strongest level of protection against object deletion and modification, ensuring compliance with WORM requirements.

A bucket policy denying `s3:DeleteObject` can be bypassed by users with the `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission (if Governance Mode was enabled) or by the root user. Furthermore, versioning alone doesn't guarantee immutability for a specific duration as required by WORM regulations.",

This contradicts the requirement that no user, including administrators, should be able to override or delete protected objects during the lock period. Governance Mode is intended for situations where some level of flexibility is needed, but it does not provide the strict immutability required for WORM compliance."

      "correct_explanation": "Options 0 and 2 are the correct answers.\n\n*   **Option 0:** Using Service Control Policies (SCPs) is the most effective way to enforce mandatory tagging at the AWS Organizations level. The first SCP denies the `ec2:RunInstances` API call if the `dataClassification` tag is not present in the request. This prevents users from launching instances without the required tag. The second SCP denies the `ec2:DeleteTags` API call for EC2 resources, preventing users from removing the tag from running instances.

The key requirements are private connectivity, security, and reliability.",
      "correct_explanation": "Option 0, using AWS PrivateLink, is the best solution. AWS PrivateLink allows you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services, services hosted by other AWS accounts (the SaaS provider in this case), and AWS Marketplace partner services. It provides private connectivity without exposing your traffic to the public internet. The SaaS provider creates a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in their VPC and exposes it as a PrivateLink service. The tech company then creates a VPC endpoint in their VPC, which connects to the SaaS provider's NLB. This establishes a private connection, ensuring that all traffic between the internal services and the SaaS provider remains within the AWS network and is not exposed to the public internet. Importantly, PrivateLink only allows the tech company to initiate connections to the SaaS provider, preventing unsolicited incoming traffic from the SaaS provider.",
      "incorrect_explanations": {
        "1": "Option 1, establishing a VPN connection using AWS Site-to-Site VPN, creates a secure tunnel, but it's more complex to set up and manage than PrivateLink. While it provides secure communication, it doesn't inherently prevent unsolicited incoming traffic from the SaaS provider. You would need to configure firewall rules to achieve that. Also, VPN connections involve more overhead and management compared to PrivateLink.",
        "2": "Option 2, setting up VPC peering, allows direct communication between the two VPCs, but it doesn't inherently prevent unsolicited incoming traffic from the SaaS provider. VPC peering establishes a network connection between two VPCs, allowing traffic to flow between them. However, it requires careful management of security groups and network ACLs to control traffic flow and prevent unwanted access. It also doesn't provide the same level of isolation and control as PrivateLink. Furthermore, VPC peering can become complex to manage as the number of peered VPCs grows.",
        "3": "Option 3, using AWS CloudFront, is designed for content delivery and caching, not for establishing private connections between internal services and APIs. CloudFront is primarily used to distribute content to users globally, caching it at edge locations to improve performance. It's not suitable for establishing a secure and private connection between internal services and a third-party API. It would also expose the traffic to the public internet, which contradicts the requirement of minimizing public internet exposure."

The key requirements are an RPO of ≤ 5 minutes and an RTO of ≤ 15 minutes, with minimal operational overhead and configuration effort. The question is testing the understanding of different DR strategies for Aurora, specifically focusing on Aurora Global Database and its capabilities for fast failover and minimal management.",
      "correct_explanations": {
        "3": "This is the most suitable solution because Aurora Global Database is designed for exactly this scenario: fast cross-region disaster recovery with minimal operational overhead. It uses storage-based replication to maintain a secondary Aurora cluster in a different AWS Region. This replication is typically very fast, easily meeting the RPO of ≤ 5 minutes. Aurora Global Database also provides managed failover capabilities, which can achieve the RTO of ≤ 15 minutes with minimal manual intervention. The managed failover process automates many of the steps involved in promoting the secondary cluster, reducing the time and effort required for failover. This solution also minimizes operational overhead because Aurora handles the replication and failover process, reducing the need for custom scripting or manual configuration."

        "0": "This solution is incorrect because using Lambda functions to export and import snapshots every 5 minutes is not efficient or reliable for achieving the required RPO and RTO. Snapshots are point-in-time backups, and restoring from a snapshot takes time, likely exceeding the 15-minute RTO. Furthermore, managing the Lambda functions, storage, and custom scripts adds significant operational overhead. The process is also prone to errors and inconsistencies, making it a less desirable DR solution.",
        "1": "This solution is incorrect because while creating an Aurora read replica in us-west-2 provides data replication, it requires a manual promotion process for failover. Manual promotion can be time-consuming and error-prone, potentially exceeding the 15-minute RTO. Monitoring replication health and executing the promotion process also adds operational overhead. Although this option is better than using snapshots, it doesn't provide the automated failover capabilities needed to meet the strict RTO and minimize operational effort. The manual intervention required makes it less ideal than Aurora Global Database.",
        "2": "This solution is incorrect because while AWS DMS can replicate data continuously, it typically introduces higher latency than Aurora Global Database's storage-based replication. This increased latency may make it difficult to consistently meet the 5-minute RPO. Furthermore, AWS DMS requires more configuration and management than Aurora Global Database. The manual failover process also increases the RTO and operational overhead compared to the managed failover provided by Aurora Global Database.

The system uses EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer for the frontend, SQS for decoupling, EC2 instances for processing, and DynamoDB for data storage. The problem is that during traffic surges, the SQS queue depth increases, and the processing tier EC2 instances reach 100% CPU utilization, causing slowdowns. The goal is to improve responsiveness and scalability during these peak periods. The key is to dynamically scale the processing tier based on the SQS queue depth, which directly reflects the backlog of orders waiting to be processed.",

The scenario involves individual developer accounts with potential for unexpected cost spikes. The ideal solution should be automated, scalable, and require minimal administrative intervention.",
      "correct_explanations": {
        "1": "This solution directly addresses the requirements by leveraging AWS Budgets. AWS Budgets allows defining spending thresholds for each developer account. It provides budget alerts to notify developers when actual or forecasted usage exceeds the set limit. Critically, it supports attaching Budgets actions, enabling automatic application of a restrictive DenyAll IAM policy to the developer's primary IAM role when the budget threshold is crossed. This effectively prevents further resource provisioning and cost accumulation, fulfilling the proactive enforcement and automatic response requirements with minimal operational overhead. The DenyAll policy ensures that the developer cannot create or modify resources, effectively stopping further spending."

      "incorrect_explanations": {
        "0": "While this option attempts to monitor costs, it relies on a Lambda function running in each developer account, which increases operational overhead for deployment, maintenance, and potential errors. Furthermore, using AWS Config remediation rules triggered by cost analysis is a more complex and less direct approach compared to AWS Budgets actions. The daily execution frequency might not be frequent enough to prevent significant overspending before the function runs. Cost Explorer API calls and custom logic add complexity and potential points of failure.",
        "2": "This option relies on developers to actively monitor their resource consumption and take action, which is not a proactive or automated solution. It increases the operational burden on the developers and does not guarantee timely responses to overspending. Email notifications and dashboards are helpful for visibility, but they do not enforce budget limits or automatically prevent further cost accumulation. This approach is reactive rather than proactive.",
        "3": "While AWS Service Catalog can help control resource types and pricing, it does not directly address the requirement of proactively enforcing budget limits and automatically responding to overspending. The scheduled Lambda function to stop and restart resources is a crude method of cost control that can disrupt development workflows and may not prevent overspending within the allowed timeframe. It also adds operational overhead for managing the Lambda functions and schedules in each developer account. This approach is more about resource management than cost control and doesn't directly address the budget enforcement requirement."

The goal is to refactor the workflow to prevent multiple orders from being created for the same transaction, even when timeouts and retries occur.

The data volume is significant (petabytes), and the queries are used to determine product popularity by date and region.",
      "correct_explanations": {
        "4": "This is correct because converting the CSV files to Apache Parquet format significantly improves Athena query performance. Parquet is a columnar storage format, which allows Athena to read only the necessary columns for a query, reducing the amount of data scanned. This leads to faster query execution and lower costs. Additionally, Parquet supports compression, further reducing storage costs and improving I/O performance. Using AWS Glue ETL to perform this conversion is a suitable approach.",
        "2": "This is correct because storing data as large, single objects in S3 is generally more efficient for Athena. Athena works best with larger files as it reduces the overhead of processing numerous small files. While there's a balance to be struck to avoid excessively large files that might hinder parallel processing, the question implies the current file sizes are causing issues, suggesting they are too small. By consolidating smaller files into larger objects, Athena can process the data more efficiently, improving query performance and reducing the number of S3 requests."

        "0": "This is incorrect because reducing S3 object sizes further would likely worsen the performance of Athena queries. Athena performs better with fewer, larger files than with many small files, as it reduces the overhead of processing each individual file. Reducing object sizes to less than 126 MB would increase the number of files and the associated overhead.",
        "1": "This is incorrect because while partitioning data by date and region is a good practice for optimizing Athena queries, it doesn't directly address the immediate performance and reliability issues described in the scenario. Partitioning helps Athena to scan only the relevant data based on the query's WHERE clause, but it doesn't solve the underlying problem of inefficient data format (CSV) and potentially too many small files. While beneficial, it's not the most impactful solution compared to converting to Parquet and optimizing file sizes."
