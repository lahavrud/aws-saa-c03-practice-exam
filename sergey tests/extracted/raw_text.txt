QUESTION 1 
A company has a website hosted on AWS The website is behind an Application Load Balancer 
(ALB) that is configured to handle HTTP and HTTPS separately. The company wants to forward 
all requests to the website so that the requests will use HTTPS. 
What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement? 
 
A. Update the ALB's network ACL to accept only HTTPS traffic 
B. Create a rule that replaces the HTTP in the URL with HTTPS. 
C. Create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. 
D. Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer configured to use Server Name Indication 
(SNI). 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
To redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, a solutions architect should create a listener rule on the ALB 
to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Option A is not correct because network ACLs do not have the 
ability to redirect traffic. Option B is not correct because it does not redirect traffic, it only replaces 
the URL. Option D is not correct because a Network Load Balancer does not have the ability to 
handle HTTPS traffic.

QUESTION 2 
A company is developing a two-tier web application on AWS. The company's developers have 
deployed the application on an Amazon EC2 instance that connects directly to a backend 
Amazon RDS database. The company must not hardcode database credentials in the application. 
The company must also implement a solution to automatically rotate the database credentials on 
a regular basis. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 
 
A. Store the database credentials in the instance metadata.  
Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rules to run a scheduled AWS Lambda 
function that updates the RDS credentials and instance metadata at the same time. 
B. Store the database credentials in a configuration file in an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket.  
Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rules to run a scheduled AWS Lambda 
function that updates the RDS credentials and the credentials in the configuration file at the 
same time.  
Use S3 Versioning to ensure the ability to fall back to previous values. 
C. Store the database credentials as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager.  
Turn on automatic rotation for the secret.  
Attach the required permission to the EC2 role to grant access to the secret. 
D. Store the database credentials as encrypted parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter 
Store.  
Turn on automatic rotation for the encrypted parameters. 
Attach the required permission to the EC2 role to grant access to the encrypted parameters. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Secrets manager supports Autorotation unlike Parameter store. 
AWS Secrets Manager is a service that enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve 
database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. By storing the 
database credentials as a secret in Secrets Manager, you can ensure that they are not

3 
hardcoded in the application and that they are automatically rotated on a regular basis. To grant 
the EC2 instance access to the secret, you can attach the required permission to the EC2 role. 
This will allow the application to retrieve the secret from Secrets Manager as needed.

QUESTION 3 
A company is deploying a new public web application to AWS. The application will run behind an 
Application Load Balancer (ALB).  
The application needs to be encrypted at the edge with an SSL/TLS certificate that is issued by 
an external certificate authority (CA). 
The certificate must be rotated each year before the certificate expires. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue an SSL/TLS certificate.  
Apply the certificate to the ALB.  
Use the managed renewal feature to automatically rotate the certificate. 
B. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue an SSL/TLS certificate.  
Import the key material from the certificate. Apply the certificate to the ALB.  
Use the managed renewal feature to automatically rotate the certificate. 
C. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Private Certificate Authority to issue an SSL/TLS 
certificate from the root CA.  
Apply the certificate to the ALB.  
Use the managed renewal feature to automatically rotate the certificate. 
D. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to import an SSL/TLS certificate. 
Apply the certificate to the ALB.  
Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send a notification when the 
certificate is nearing expiration.  
Rotate the certificate manually. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
ACM does not manage the renewal process for imported certificates. You are responsible for 
monitoring the expiration date of your imported certificates and for renewing them before they 
expire.

QUESTION 4 
A company runs its infrastructure on AWS and has a registered base of 700,000 users for its 
document management application. The company intends to create a product that converts 
large .pdf files to .jpg image files. The .pdf files average 5 MB in size. The company needs to 
store the original files and the converted files. A solutions architect must design a scalable 
solution to accommodate demand that will grow rapidly over time. 
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 
 
A. Save the .pdf files to Amazon S3.  
Configure an S3 PUT event to invoke an AWS Lambda function to convert the files to .jpg 
format and store them back in Amazon S3. 
B. Save the .pdf files to Amazon DynamoDUse the DynamoDB Streams feature to invoke an AWS 
Lambda function to convert the files to .jpg format and store them back in DynamoDB.

C. Upload the .pdf files to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application that includes Amazon EC2 
instances, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage, and an Auto Scaling group.  
Use a program in the EC2 instances to convert the files to .jpg format. Save the .pdf files and 
the .jpg files in the EBS store. 
D. Upload the .pdf files to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application that includes Amazon EC2 
instances, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) storage, and an Auto Scaling group.  
Use a program in the EC2 instances to convert the file to .jpg format. Save the .pdf files and 
the .jpg files in the EBS store. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Elastic BeanStalk is expensive, and DocumentDB has a 400KB max to upload files. So Lambda 
and S3 should be the one. 
 
 
QUESTION 5 
A company has more than 5 TB of file data on Windows file servers that run on premises. Users 
and applications interact with the data each day. 
The company is moving its Windows workloads to AWS. As the company continues this process, 
the company requires access to AWS and on-premises file storage with minimum latency. The 
company needs a solution that minimizes operational overhead and requires no significant 
changes to the existing file access patterns. The company uses an AWS Site-to-Site VPN 
connection for connectivity to AWS. 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Deploy and configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on AWS.  
Move the on-premises file data to FSx for Windows File Server.  
Reconfigure the workloads to use FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. 
B. Deploy and configure an Amazon S3 File Gateway on premises. 
Move the on-premises file data to the S3 File Gateway. 
Reconfigure the on-premises workloads and the cloud workloads to use the S3 File Gateway 
C. Deploy and configure an Amazon S3 File Gateway on premises. 
Move the on-premises file data to Amazon S3. 
Reconfigure the workloads to use either Amazon S3 directly or the S3 File Gateway, depending 
on each workload's location. 
D. Deploy and configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on AWS.  
Deploy and configure an Amazon FSx File Gateway on premises. 
Move the on-premises file data to the FSx File Gateway. 
Configure the cloud workloads to use FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. 
Configure the on-premises workloads to use the FSx File Gateway. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Amazon FSx File Gateway (FSx File Gateway) is a new File Gateway type that provides low 
latency and efficient access to in-cloud FSx for Windows File Server file shares from your on-
premises facility. If you maintain on-premises file storage because of latency or bandwidth 
requirements, you can instead use FSx File Gateway for seamless access to fully managed, 
highly reliable, and virtually unlimited Windows file shares provided in the AWS Cloud by FSx for 
Windows File Server.

5 
format. The hospital needs to modify the Lambda code to identify protected health information 
(PHI) in the reports. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational 
overhead? 
 
A. Use existing Python libraries to extract the text from the reports and to identify the PHI from the 
extracted text. 
B. Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports.  
Use Amazon SageMaker to identify the PHI from the extracted text. 
C. Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports.  
Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text. 
D. Use Amazon Rekognition to extract the text from the reports.  
Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Using Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports, and Amazon Comprehend Medical to 
identify the PHI from the extracted text, would be the most efficient solution as it would involve the 
least operational overhead. Textract is specifically designed for extracting text from documents, 
and Comprehend Medical is a fully managed service that can accurately identify PHI in medical 
text. This solution would require minimal maintenance and would not incur any additional costs 
beyond the usage fees for Textract and Comprehend Medical. 
 
 
QUESTION 7 
A company has an application that generates a large number of files, each approximately 5 MB in 
size. The files are stored in Amazon S3. Company policy requires the files to be stored for 4 
years before they can be deleted. Immediate accessibility is always required as the files contain 
critical business data that is not easy to reproduce. The files are frequently accessed in the first 
30 days of the object creation but are rarely accessed after the first 30 days. 
Which storage solution is MOST cost-effective? 
 
A. Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move Mm from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier 30 days from 
object creation. 
Delete the Tiles 4 years after object creation 
B. Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move tiles from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-infrequent 
Access (S3 One Zone-IA) 30 days from object creation.  
Delete the fees 4 years after object creation 
C. Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard-infrequent Access (S3 
Standard -lA) 30 from object creation.  
Delete the ties 4 years after object creation 
D. Create an S3 bucket Lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent 
Access (S3 Standard-IA) 30 days from object creation. 
Move the files to S3 Glacier 4 years after object carton. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Immediate accessibility is always required as the files contain critical business data that is not 
easy to reproduce. 
If they do not explicitly mention that they are using Glacier Instant Retrieval, we should assume 
that Glacier -> takes more time to retrieve and may not meet the requirements. 
 
 
QUESTION 8 
A company hosts an application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes 
messages from an Amazon SQS queue writes to an Amazon RDS table and deletes the

message from the queue Occasional duplicate records are found in the RDS table. The SQS 
queue does not contain any duplicate messages. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to ensure messages are being processed once only? 
 
A. Use the CreateQueue API call to create a new queue 
B. Use the Add Permission API call to add appropriate permissions 
C. Use the ReceiveMessage API call to set an appropriate wail time 
D. Use the ChangeMessageVisibility APi call to increase the visibility timeout 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
The visibility timeout begins when Amazon SQS returns a message. During this time, the 
consumer processes and deletes the message. However, if the consumer fails before deleting the 
message and your system doesn't call the DeleteMessage action for that message before the 
visibility timeout expires, the message becomes visible to other consumers and the message is 
received again. If a message must be received only once, your consumer should delete it within 
the duration of the visibility timeout. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-
visibility-timeout.html 
 
Keyword: SQS queue writes to an Amazon RDS From this, Option D best suite &amp; other 
Options ruled out [Option A -You can't intruduce one more Queue in the existing one; Option B - 
only Permission &amp; Option C -Only Retrieves Messages] FIF O queues are designed to never 
introduce duplicate messages. However, your message producer might introduce duplicates in 
certain scenarios: for example, if the producer sends a message, does not receive a response, 
and then resends the same message. Amazon SQS APIs provide deduplication functionality that 
prevents your message producer from sending duplicates. Any duplicates introduced by the 
message producer are removed within a 5-minute deduplication interval. For standard queues, 
you might occasionally receive a duplicate copy of a message (at-least-once delivery). If you use 
a standard queue, you must design your applications to be idempotent (that is, they must not be 
affected adversely when processing the same message more than once). 
 
 
QUESTION 9 
A solutions architect is designing a new hybrid architecture to extend a company s on-premises 
infrastructure to AWS. The company requires a highly available connection with consistent low 
latency to an AWS Region. The company needs to minimize costs and is willing to accept slower 
traffic if the primary connection fails. 
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Provision an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region. 
Provision a VPN connection as a backup if the primary Direct Connect connection fails. 
B. Provision a VPN tunnel connection to a Region for private connectivity.  
Provision a second VPN tunnel for private connectivity and as a backup if the primary VPN 
connection fails. 
C. Provision an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region. 
Provision a second Direct Connect connection to the same Region as a backup if the primary 
Direct Connect connection fails. 
D. Provision an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region. 
Use the Direct Connect failover attribute from the AWS CLI to automatically create a backup 
connection if the primary Direct Connect connection fails. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation:

"In some cases, this connection alone is not enough. It is always better to guarantee a fallback 
connection as the backup of DX. There are several options, but implementing it with an AWS 
Site-To-Site VPN is a real cost-effective solution that can be exploited to reduce costs or, in the 
meantime, wait for the setup of a second DX."

QUESTION 10 
A company is running a business-critical web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an 
Application Load Balancer. The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The application 
uses an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database that is deployed in a single Availability Zone. The 
company wants the application to be highly available with minimum downtime and minimum loss 
of data. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational effort? 
 
A. Place the EC2 instances in different AWS Regions.  
Use Amazon Route 53 health checks to redirect traffic.  
Use Aurora PostgreSQL Cross-Region Replication. 
B. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use multiple Availability Zones.  
Configure the database as Multi-AZ.  
Configure an Amazon RDS Proxy instance for the database. 
C. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use one Availability Zone.  
Generate hourly snapshots of the database.  
Recover the database from the snapshots in the event of a failure. 
D. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use multiple AWS Regions.  
Write the data from the application to Amazon S3.  
Use S3 Event Notifications to launch an AWS Lambda function to write the data to the 
database. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
By configuring the Auto Scaling group to use multiple Availability Zones, the application will be 
able to continue running even if one Availability Zone goes down. Configuring the database as 
Multi-AZ will also ensure that the database remains available in the event of a failure in one 
Availability Zone. Using an Amazon RDS Proxy instance for the database will allow the 
application to automatically route traffic to healthy database instances, further increasing the 
availability of the application. This solution will meet the requirements for high availability with 
minimal operational effort.

QUESTION 11 
A company's HTTP application is behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB). The NLB's target group 
is configured to use an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with multiple EC2 instances that run the 
web service. 
 
The company notices that the NLB is not detecting HTTP errors for the application. These errors 
require a manual restart of the EC2 instances that run the web service. The company needs to 
improve the application's availability without writing custom scripts or code. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Enable HTTP health checks on the NLB. supplying the URL of the company's application.

QUESTION 12 
A company runs a shopping application that uses Amazon DynamoDB to store customer 
information. In case of data corruption, a solutions architect needs to design a solution that meets 
a recovery point objective (RPO) of 15 minutes and a recovery time objective (RTO) of 1 hour. 
 
What should the solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Configure DynamoDB global tables.  
For RPO recovery, point the application to a different AWS Region. 
B. Configure DynamoDB point-in-time recovery.  
For RPO recovery, restore to the desired point in time. 
C. Export the DynamoDB data to Amazon S3 Glacier on a daily basis.  
For RPO recovery, import the data from S3 Glacier to DynamoDB. 
D. Schedule Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots for the DynamoDB table every 
15 minutes.  
For RPO recovery, restore the DynamoDB table by using the EBS snapshot. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Point in Time Recovery is designed as a continuous backup juts to recover it fast. It covers 
perfectly the RPO, and probably the RTO.

QUESTION 13 
A company runs a photo processing application that needs to frequently upload and download 
pictures from Amazon S3 buckets that are located in the same AWS Region. A solutions architect 
has noticed an increased cost in data transfer fees and needs to implement a solution to reduce 
these costs. 
 
How can the solutions architect meet this requirement? 
 
A. Deploy Amazon API Gateway into a public subnet and adjust the route table to route S3 calls 
through It. 
B. Deploy a NAT gateway into a public subnet and attach an end point policy that allows access to 
the S3 buckets. 
C. Deploy the application Into a public subnet and allow it to route through an internet gateway to

access the S3 Buckets 
D. Deploy an S3 VPC gateway endpoint into the VPC and attach an endpoint policy that allows 
access to the S3 buckets. 
 
Explanation: 
By deploying an S3 VPC gateway endpoint, the application can access the S3 buckets over a 
private network connection within the VPC, eliminating the need for data transfer over the 
internet. This can help reduce data transfer fees as well as improve the performance of the 
application. The endpoint policy can be used to specify which S3 buckets the application has 
access to. 
 
 
QUESTION 14 
A company recently launched Linux-based application instances on Amazon EC2 in a private 
subnet and launched a Linux-based bastion host on an Amazon EC2 instance in a public subnet 
of a VPC. A solutions architect needs to connect from the on-premises network, through the 
company's internet connection, to the bastion host, and to the application servers. The solutions 
architect must make sure that the security groups of all the EC2 instances will allow that access. 
Which combination of steps should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? 
(Choose two.) 
 
A. Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access 
from the application instances 
B. Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access 
from the internal IP range for the company 
C. Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access 
from the external IP range for the company 
D. Replace the current security group of the application instances with one that allows inbound 
SSH access from only the private IP address of the bastion host 
E. Replace the current security group of the application instances with one that allows inbound 
SSH access from only the public IP address of the bastion host 
 
Answer: CD 
Explanation: 
C because from on-prem network to bastion through internet (using on-prem resource's public 
IP). 
D because bastion and ec2 is in same VPC, meaning bastion can communicate to EC2 via it's 
private IP address. 
 
 
QUESTION 15 
A solutions architect is designing a two-tier web application. The application consists of a public-
facing web tier hosted on Amazon EC2 in public subnets. The database tier consists of Microsoft 
SQL Server running on Amazon EC2 in a private subnet. Security is a high priority for the 
company. 
How should security groups be configured in this situation? (Choose two.) 
 
A. Configure the security group for the web tier to allow inbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0. 
B. Configure the security group for the web tier to allow outbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0. 
C. Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound traffic on port 1433 from the 
security group for the web tier. 
D. Configure the security group for the database tier to allow outbound traffic on ports 443 and 
1433 to the security group for the web tier. 
E. Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound traffic on ports 443 and 1433

from the security group for the web tier. 
 
Answer: AC 
Explanation: 
"Security groups create an outbound rule for every inbound rule." Not completely right. Statefull 
does NOT mean that if you create an inbound (or outbound) rule, it will create an outbound (or 
inbound) rule. What it does mean is: suppose you create an inbound rule on port 443 for the X ip. 
When a request enters on port 443 from X ip, it will allow traffic out for that request in the port 
443. However, if you look at the outbound rules, there will not be any outbound rule on port 443 
unless explicitly create it. In ACLs, which are stateless, you would have to create an inbound rule 
to allow incoming requests and an outbound rule to allow your application responds to those 
incoming requests.

QUESTION 16 
A company wants to move a multi-tiered application from on premises to the AWS Cloud to 
improve the application's performance. The application consists of application tiers that 
communicate with each other by way of RESTful services. Transactions are dropped when one 
tier becomes overloaded. A solutions architect must design a solution that resolves these issues 
and modernizes the application. 
 
Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient? 
 
A. Use Amazon API Gateway and direct transactions to the AWS Lambda functions as the 
application layer.  
Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) as the communication layer between 
application services. 
B. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze the application performance history to determine 
the server's peak utilization during the performance failures.  
Increase the size of the application server's Amazon EC2 instances to meet the peak 
requirements. 
C. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to handle the messaging between 
application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group.  
Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SNS queue length and scale up and down as required. 
D. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to handle the messaging between 
application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group.  
Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SQS queue length and scale up when communication 
failures are detected. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Lambda = serverless + autoscale (modernize), SQS= decouple (no more drops)

group to add and remove nodes based on the number of items in the SQS queue" 
In this case we need to find a durable and loosely coupled solution for storing jobs. Amazon SQS 
is ideal for this use case and can be configured to use dynamic scaling based on the number of 
jobs waiting in the queue.To configure this scaling you can use the backlog per instance metric 
with the target value being the acceptable backlog per instance to maintain. You can calculate 
these numbers as follows: Backlog per instance: To calculate your backlog per instance, start 
with the ApproximateNumberOfMessages queue attribute to determine the length of the SQS 
queue

enabled 
B. Store the uploaded documents in an Amazon S3 bucket.  
Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to archive the documents periodically. 
C. Store the uploaded documents in an Amazon S3 bucket with S3 Versioning enabled. 
Configure an ACL to restrict all access to read-only. 
D. Store the uploaded documents on an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. 
Access the data by mounting the volume in read-only mode. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
You can use S3 Object Lock to store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. 
Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time 
or indefinitely. You can use S3 Object Lock to meet regulatory requirements that require WORM 
storage, or add an extra layer of protection against object changes and deletion. 
Versioning is required and automatically activated as Object Lock is enabled.

QUESTION 27 
A company has several web servers that need to frequently access a common Amazon RDS 
MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance. The company wants a secure method for the web servers to 
connect to the database while meeting a security requirement to rotate user credentials 
frequently. 
Which solution meets these requirements? 
 
A. Store the database user credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. 
Grant the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to access AWS Secrets 
Manager. 
B. Store the database user credentials in AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter. 
Grant the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to access OpsCenter. 
C. Store the database user credentials in a secure Amazon S3 bucket. 
Grant the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to retrieve credentials and 
access the database. 
D. Store the database user credentials in files encrypted with AWS Key Management Service 
(AWS KMS) on the web server file system. The web server should be able to decrypt the files 
and access the database. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Secrets Manager enables you to replace hardcoded credentials in your code, including 
passwords, with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically. This 
helps ensure the secret can't be compromised by someone examining your code, because the 
secret no longer exists in the code. Also, you can configure Secrets Manager to automatically 
rotate the secret for you according to a specified schedule. This enables you to replace long-term 
secrets with short-term ones, significantly reducing the risk of compromise.

QUESTION 29 
A survey company has gathered data for several years from areas m\ the United States. The 
company hosts the data in an Amazon S3 bucket that is 3 TB in size and growing. The company 
has started to share the data with a European marketing firm that has S3 buckets. The company 
wants to ensure that its data transfer costs remain as low as possible. 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Configure the Requester Pays feature on the company's S3 bucket 
B. Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication from the company's S3 bucket to one of the marketing 
firm's S3 buckets.

the company's S3 bucket. 
D. Configure the company's S3 bucket to use S3 Intelligent-Tiering Sync the S3 bucket to one of 
the marketing firm's S3 buckets 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Typically, you configure buckets to be Requester Pays buckets when you want to share data but 
not incur charges associated with others accessing the data. For example, you might use 
Requester Pays buckets when making available large datasets, such as zip code directories, 
reference data, geospatial information, or web crawling data.

QUESTION 30 
A company uses Amazon S3 to store its confidential audit documents. The S3 bucket uses 
bucket policies to restrict access to audit team IAM user credentials according to the principle of 
least privilege. Company managers are worried about accidental deletion of documents in the S3 
bucket and want a more secure solution. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to secure the audit documents? 
 
A. Enable the versioning and MFA Delete features on the S3 bucket. 
B. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the IAM user credentials for each audit team IAM 
user account. 
C. Add an S3 Lifecycle policy to the audit team's IAM user accounts to deny the s3:DeleteObject 
action during audit dates. 
D. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the S3 bucket and restrict audit 
team IAM user accounts from accessing the KMS key. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
This will secure the audit documents by providing an additional layer of protection against 
accidental deletion. With versioning enabled, any deleted or overwritten objects in the S3 bucket 
will be preserved as previous versions, allowing the company to recover them if needed. With 
MFA Delete enabled, any delete request made to the S3 bucket will require the use of an MFA 
code, which provides an additional layer of security.

When you enable automatic key rotation for a customer managed key, AWS KMS generates new 
cryptographic material for the KMS key every year. AWS KMS also saves the KMS key's older 
cryptographic material in perpetuity so it can be used to decrypt data that the KMS key encrypted. 
Key rotation in AWS KMS is a cryptographic best practice that is designed to be transparent and 
easy to use. AWS KMS supports optional automatic key rotation only for customer managed 
CMKs. Enable and disable key rotation. Automatic key rotation is disabled by default on customer 
managed CMKs. 
When you enable (or re-enable) key rotation, AWS KMS automatically rotates the CMK 365 days 
after the enable date and every 365 days thereafter.

QUESTION 38 
A company needs to store data in Amazon S3 and must prevent the data from being changed. 
The company wants new objects that are uploaded to Amazon S3 to remain unchangeable for a 
nonspecific amount of time until the company decides to modify the objects. Only specific users in 
the company's AWS account can have the ability 10 delete the objects. 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Create an S3 Glacier vault.  
Apply a write-once, read-many (WORM) vault lock policy to the objects. 
B. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled.  
Enable versioning.  
Set a retention period of 100 years.  
Use governance mode as the S3 bucket’s default retention mode for new objects. 
C. Create an S3 bucket.  
Use AWS CloudTrail to track any S3 API events that modify the objects.  
Upon notification, restore the modified objects from any backup versions that the company has. 
D. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled.  
Enable versioning.  
Add a legal hold to the objects.  
Add the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission to the IAM policies of users who need to delete the 
objects. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
"The Object Lock legal hold operation enables you to place a legal hold on an object version. Like 
setting a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or 
deleted. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect 
until removed."

QUESTION 50 
A company is running an online transaction processing (OLTP) workload on AWS. This workload 
uses an unencrypted Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ deployment. Daily database 
snapshots are taken from this instance. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to ensure the database and snapshots are always encrypted 
moving forward? 
 
A. Encrypt a copy of the latest DB snapshot.  
Replace existing DB instance by restoring the encrypted snapshot 
B. Create a new encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume and copy the 
snapshots to it. 
Enable encryption on the DB instance. 
C. Copy the snapshots and enable encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). 
Restore encrypted snapshot to an existing DB instance. 
D. Copy the snapshots to an Amazon S3 bucket that is encrypted using server-side encryption with

What should the solutions architect recommend? 
 
A. Implement EC2 Spot Instances 
B. Purchase EC2 Reserved Instances 
C. Implement EC2 On-Demand Instances 
D. Implement the processing on AWS Lambda 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
EC2 Spot Instances allow users to bid on spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity and can be a 
cost-effective solution for stateless, interruptible workloads that can be started and stopped at any 
time. Since the batch processing job is stateless, can be started and stopped at any time, and 
typically takes upwards of 60 minutes to complete, EC2 Spot Instances would be a good fit for 
this workload. 
 
 
QUESTION 54 
A company runs its two-tier ecommerce website on AWS. The web tier consists of a load 
balancer that sends traffic to Amazon EC2 instances. The database tier uses an Amazon RDS 
DB instance. The EC2 instances and the RDS DB instance should not be exposed to the public 
internet. The EC2 instances require internet access to complete payment processing of orders 
through a third-party web service. The application must be highly available. 
 
Which combination of configuration options will meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 
 
A. Use an Auto Scaling group to launch the EC2 instances in private subnets.  
Deploy an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets. 
B. Configure a VPC with two private subnets and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. 
Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the private subnets. 
C. Use an Auto Scaling group to launch the EC2 instances in public subnets across two Availability 
Zones.  
Deploy an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets. 
D. Configure a VPC with one public subnet, one private subnet, and two NAT gateways across two 
Availability Zones.  
Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet. 
E. Configure a VPC with two public subnets, two private subnets, and two NAT gateways across 
two Availability Zones.  
Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the public subnets. 
 
Answer: AE 
Explanation: 
Before you begin: Decide which two Availability Zones you will use for your EC2 instances. 
Configure your virtual private cloud (VPC) with at least one public subnet in each of these 
Availability Zones. These public subnets are used to configure the load balancer. You can launch 
your EC2 instances in other subnets of these Availability Zones instead.

QUESTION 56 
A company runs its ecommerce application on AWS. Every new order is published as a message 
in a RabbitMQ queue that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a single Availability Zone. These 
messages are processed by a different application that runs on a separate EC2 instance. This 
application stores the details in a PostgreSQL database on another EC2 instance. All the EC2 
instances are in the same Availability Zone. 
The company needs to redesign its architecture to provide the highest availability with the least 
operational overhead. 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Migrate the queue to a redundant pair (active/standby) of RabbitMQ instances on Amazon MQ. 
Create a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group (or EC2 instances that host the application.  
Create another Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the PostgreSQL 
database. 
B. Migrate the queue to a redundant pair (active/standby) of RabbitMQ instances on Amazon MQ. 
Create a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the application.  
Migrate the database to run on a Multi-AZ deployment of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. 
C. Create a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the RabbitMQ queue.  
Create another Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the application.  
Migrate the database to run on a Multi-AZ deployment of Amazon RDS fqjPostgreSQL. 
D. Create a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the RabbitMQ queue.  
Create another Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the application.  
Create a third Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the PostgreSQL 
database. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Migrating to Amazon MQ reduces the overhead on the queue management. C and D are 
dismissed. 
Deciding between A and B means deciding to go for an AutoScaling group for EC2 or an RDS for 
Postgress (both multi- AZ). The RDS option has less operational impact, as provide as a service 
the tools and software required. Consider for instance, the effort to add an additional node like a 
read replica, to the DB.

QUESTION 57 
A reporting team receives files each day in an Amazon S3 bucket. The reporting team manually 
reviews and copies the files from this initial S3 bucket to an analysis S3 bucket each day at the 
same time to use with Amazon QuickSight. Additional teams are starting to send more files in 
larger sizes to the initial S3 bucket.

The reporting team wants to move the files automatically analysis S3 bucket as the files enter the 
initial S3 bucket. The reporting team also wants to use AWS Lambda functions to run pattern-
matching code on the copied data. In addition, the reporting team wants to send the data files to a 
pipeline in Amazon SageMaker Pipelines. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST operational 
overhead? 
 
A. Create a Lambda function to copy the files to the analysis S3 bucket.  
Create an S3 event notification for the analysis S3 bucket.  
Configure Lambda and SageMaker Pipelines as destinations of the event notification.  
Configure s30bjectCreated:Put as the event type. 
B. Create a Lambda function to copy the files to the analysis S3 bucket.  
Configure the analysis S3 bucket to send event notifications to Amazon EventBridge (Amazon 
CloudWatch Events).  
Configure an ObjectCreated rule in EventBridge (CloudWatch Events).  
Configure Lambda and SageMaker Pipelines as targets for the rule. 
C. Configure S3 replication between the S3 buckets.  
Create an S3 event notification for the analysis S3 bucket.  
Configure Lambda and SageMaker Pipelines as destinations of the event notification. 
Configure s30bjectCreated:Put as the event type. 
D. Configure S3 replication between the S3 buckets.  
Configure the analysis S3 bucket to send event notifications to Amazon EventBridge (Amazon 
CloudWatch Events).  
Configure an ObjectCreated rule in EventBridge (CloudWatch Events).  
Configure Lambda and SageMaker Pipelines as targets for the rule. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
The files are getting large, less operational overhead - so will choose S3 replication. Event bridge 
is far more advanced than S3 event notification and they support multiple targets. S3 Event 
notification may not support Sagemaker. Also filtering and pattern matching available in Event 
bridge.  
 
 
QUESTION 58 
A solutions architect needs to help a company optimize the cost of running an application on 
AWS. The application will use Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda for 
compute within the architecture. 
 
The EC2 instances will run the data ingestion layer of the application. EC2 usage will be sporadic 
and unpredictable. Workloads that run on EC2 instances can be interrupted at any time. The 
application front end will run on Fargate, and Lambda will serve the API layer. The front-end 
utilization and API layer utilization will be predictable over the course of the next year. 
 
Which combination of purchasing options will provide the MOST cost-effective solution for hosting 
this application? (Choose two.) 
 
A. Use Spot Instances for the data ingestion layer 
B. Use On-Demand Instances for the data ingestion layer 
C. Purchase a 1-year Compute Savings Plan for the front end and API layer. 
D. Purchase 1-year All Upfront Reserved instances for the data ingestion layer. 
E. Purchase a 1-year EC2 instance Savings Plan for the front end and API layer.

Answer: AC 
Explanation: 
EC2 instance Savings Plan saves 72% while Compute Savings Plans saves 66%. But according 
to link, it says "Compute Savings Plans provide the most flexibility and help to reduce your costs 
by up to 66%. These plans automatically apply to EC2 instance usage regardless of instance 
family, size, AZ, region, OS or tenancy, and also apply to Fargate and Lambda usage." EC2 
instance Savings Plans are not applied to Fargate or Lambda.

QUESTION 59 
A company runs a web-based portal that provides users with global breaking news, local alerts, 
and weather updates. The portal delivers each user a personalized view by using mixture of static 
and dynamic content. Content is served over HTTPS through an API server running on an 
Amazon EC2 instance behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company wants the 
portal to provide this content to its users across the world as quickly as possible. 
 
How should a solutions architect design the application to ensure the LEAST amount of latency 
for all users? 
 
A. Deploy the application stack in a single AWS Region.  
Use Amazon CloudFront to serve all static and dynamic content by specifying the ALB as an 
origin. 
B. Deploy the application stack in two AWS Regions.  
Use an Amazon Route 53 latency routing policy to serve all content from the ALB in the closest 
Region. 
C. Deploy the application stack in a single AWS Region.  
Use Amazon CloudFront to serve the static content.  
Serve the dynamic content directly from the ALB. 
D. Deploy the application stack in two AWS Regions.  
Use an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to serve all content from the ALB in the 
closest Region. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web 
content.

QUESTION 60 
A gaming company is designing a highly available architecture. The application runs on a 
modified Linux kernel and supports only UDP-based traffic. The company needs the front-end tier 
to provide the best possible user experience. That tier must have low latency, route traffic to the 
nearest edge location, and provide static IP addresses for entry into the application endpoints. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Configure Amazon Route 53 to forward requests to an Application Load Balancer.  
Use AWS Lambda for the application in AWS Application Auto Scaling. 
B. Configure Amazon CloudFront to forward requests to a Network Load Balancer.  
Use AWS Lambda for the application in an AWS Application Auto Scaling group. 
C. Configure AWS Global Accelerator to forward requests to a Network Load Balancer.

Use Amazon EC2 instances for the application in an EC2 Auto Scaling group. 
D. Configure Amazon API Gateway to forward requests to an Application Load Balancer.  
Use Amazon EC2 instances for the application in an EC2 Auto Scaling group. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global 
network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for both 
cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration 
and dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of 
applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or 
more AWS Regions. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming 
(UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require 
static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with AWS 
Shield for DDoS protection.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.html  
#Aurora.Replication.Replicas Aurora Replicas have two main purposes. You can issue queries to 
them to scale the read operations for your application. You typically do so by connecting to the 
reader endpoint of the cluster. That way, Aurora can spread the load for read-only connections 
across as many Aurora Replicas as you have in the cluster. Aurora Replicas also help to increase 
availability. If the writer instance in a cluster becomes unavailable, Aurora automatically promotes 
one of the reader instances to take its place as the new writer.

destination. 
Modify the Lambda function to process messages in the queue. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
To ensure that all notifications are eventually processed, the best solution would be to configure 
an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue as the on-failure destination for the SNS topic. 
This will allow the notifications to be retried until they are successfully processed. The Lambda 
function can then be modified to process messages in the queue, ensuring that all notifications 
are eventually processed. Option D, "Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon 
SQS) queue as the on-failure destination. Modify the Lambda function to process messages in 
the queue," is the correct answer. 
 
 
QUESTION 67 
A company has a service that produces event data. The company wants to use AWS to process 
the event data as it is received.  
The data is written in a specific order that must be maintained throughout processing.  
The company wants to implement a solution that minimizes operational overhead. 
How should a solutions architect accomplish this? 
 
A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue to hold messages. 
Set up an AWS Lambda function to process messages from the queue. 
B. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to deliver notifications 
containing payloads to process.  
Configure an AWS Lambda function as a subscriber. 
C. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue to hold messages.  
Set up an AWS Lambda function to process messages from the queue independently. 
D. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to deliver notifications 
containing payloads to process.  
Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a subscriber. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-
queues.html 
FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when 
the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated. Examples of 
situations where you might use FIFO queues include the following: To make sure that user-
entered commands are run in the right order. To display the correct product price by sending 
price modifications in the right order. To prevent a student from enrolling in a course before 
registering for an account. 
 
 
QUESTION 68 
A company is migrating an application from on-premises servers to Amazon EC2 instances. As 
part of the migration design requirements, a solutions architect must implement infrastructure 
metric alarms. The company does not need to take action if CPU utilization increases to more 
than 50% for a short burst of time. However, if the CPU utilization increases to more than 50% 
and read IOPS on the disk are high at the same time, the company needs to act as soon as 
possible. The solutions architect also must reduce false alarms. 
 
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Create Amazon CloudWatch composite alarms where possible.

B. Create Amazon CloudWatch dashboards to visualize the metrics and react to issues quickly. 
C. Create Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics canaries to monitor the application and raise an alarm. 
D. Create single Amazon CloudWatch metric alarms with multiple metric thresholds where 
possible. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Composite alarms determine their states by monitoring the states of other alarms. You can **use 
composite alarms to reduce alarm noise**. For example, you can create a composite alarm where 
the underlying metric alarms go into ALARM when they meet specific conditions. You then can 
set up your composite alarm to go into ALARM and send you notifications when the underlying 
metric alarms go into ALARM by configuring the underlying metric alarms never to take actions. 
Currently, composite alarms can take the following actions:

QUESTION 71 
A company sells ringtones created from clips of popular songs. The files containing the ringtones 
are stored in Amazon S3 Standard and are at least 128 KB in size. The company has millions of 
files, but downloads are infrequent for ringtones older than 90 days. The company needs to save 
money on storage while keeping the most accessed files readily available for its users. 
 
Which action should the company take to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 
 
A. Configure S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage for the initial storage tier of 
the objects. 
B. Move the files to S3 Intelligent-Tiering and configure it to move objects to a less expensive 
storage tier after 90 days. 
C. Configure S3 inventory to manage objects and move them to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access 
(S3 Standard-1A) after 90 days. 
D. Implement an S3 Lifecycle policy that moves the objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-
Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-1A) after 90 days. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
The Question talks about downloads are infrequent older than 90 days which means files less 
than 90 days are accessed frequently. Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) needs a 
minimum 30 days if accessed before, it costs more. 
So to access the files frequently you need a S3 Standard. After 90 days you can move it to 
Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) as its going to be less frequently accessed.

the instances. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
To make an existing application highly available and resilient while avoiding any single points of 
failure and giving the application the ability to scale to meet user demand, the best solution would 
be to deploy the application servers using Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group 
across multiple Availability Zones and use an Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ 
configuration. 
 
By using an Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ configuration, the database is automatically 
replicated across multiple Availability Zones, ensuring that the database is highly available and 
can withstand the failure of a single Availability Zone. This provides fault tolerance and avoids 
any single points of failure.

Send a message that includes the order number to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon 
SQS) FIFO queue.  
Set the payment service to retrieve the message and process the order.  
Delete the message from the queue. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
This approach ensures that the order creation and payment processing steps are separate and 
atomic. By sending the order information to an SQS FIFO queue, the payment service can 
process the order one at a time and in the order they were received. If the payment service is 
unable to process an order, it can be retried later, preventing the creation of multiple orders. The 
deletion of the message from the queue after it is processed will prevent the same message from 
being processed multiple times. 
It's worth noting that FIFO queues guarantee that messages are processed in the order they are 
received, and prevent duplicates.

QUESTION 90 
An ecommerce company has an order-processing application that uses Amazon API Gateway 
and an AWS Lambda function.  
The application stores data in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database.  
During a recent sales event, a sudden surge in customer orders occurred.  
Some customers experienced timeouts and the application did not process the orders of those 
customers.  
A solutions architect determined that the CPU utilization and memory utilization were high on the 
database because of a large number of open connections.  
The solutions architect needs to prevent the timeout errors while making the least possible 
changes to the application. 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function. 
Modify the database to be a global database in multiple AWS Regions. 
B. Use Amazon RDS Proxy to create a proxy for the database.  
Modify the Lambda function to use the RDS Proxy endpoint instead of the database endpoint. 
C. Create a read replica for the database in a different AWS Region.  
Use query string parameters in API Gateway to route traffic to the read replica. 
D. Migrate the data from Aurora PostgreSQL to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database.  
Migration Service (AWS DMS) Modify the Lambda function to use the OynamoDB table. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Many applications, including those built on modern serverless architectures, can have a large 
number of open connections to the database server and may open and close database 
connections at a high rate, exhausting database memory and compute resources. Amazon RDS 
Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving 
database efficiency and application scalability.

QUESTION 96 
A company has 150 TB of archived image data stored on-premises that needs to be moved to the 
AWS Cloud within the next month. 
The company's current network connection allows up to 100 Mbps uploads for this purpose 
during the night only. 
What is the MOST cost-effective mechanism to move this data and meet the migration deadline? 
 
A. Use AWS Snowmobile to ship the data to AWS. 
B. Order multiple AWS Snowball devices to ship the data to AWS. 
C. Enable Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration and securely upload the data. 
D. Create an Amazon S3 VPC endpoint and establish a VPN to upload the data 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
eg.6 hrs night 
6 hrs*60min/hr=360 min 
360 min*60 sec/min=21600 sec 
100 Mbps*21600 s=2160000Mb 
or 2160 Gb or 2.1 TB can only be done 
 
So, for 150 TB, we can use 2 X Snowball Edge Storage Optimised devices. 
 
Size of Snowball Edge Storage Optimised device=80 TB Size of Snowball Edge Compute 
Optimised device= 40 TB Size of Snowcone =8 TB 
Size of Snowmobile =100 PB (1 PB=1000 TB) 
 
Q: How should I choose between Snowmobile and Snowball? 
To migrate large datasets of 10PB or more in a single location, you should use Snowmobile. For 
datasets less than 10PB or distributed in multiple locations, you should use Snowball. In addition, 
you should evaluate the amount of available bandwidth in your network backbone. If you have a 
high speed backbone with hundreds of Gb/s of spare throughput, then you can use Snowmobile 
to migrate the large datasets all at once. If you have limited bandwidth on your backbone, you 
should consider using multiple Snowballs to migrate the data incrementally.

QUESTION 98 
A company wants to use AWS Systems Manager to manage a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. 
According to the company's security requirements, no EC2 instances can have internet access. A 
solutions architect needs to design network connectivity from the EC2 instances to Systems 
Manager while fulfilling this security obligation. 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Deploy the EC2 instances into a private subnet with no route to the internet. 
B. Configure an interface VPC endpoint for Systems Manager. 
Update routes to use the endpoint. 
C. Deploy a NAT gateway into a public subnet. 
Configure private subnets with a default route to the NAT gateway. 
D. Deploy an internet gateway. 
Configure a network ACL to deny traffic to all destinations except Systems Manager. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
VPC Peering connections 
VPC interface endpoints can be accessed through both intra-Region and inter-Region VPC 
peering connections. 
VPC Gateway Endpoint connections can't be extended out of a VPC. Resources on the other 
side of a VPC peering connection in your VPC can't use the gateway endpoint to communicate 
with resources in the gateway endpoint service.

QUESTION 99 
A company needs to build a reporting solution on AWS. The solution must support SQL queries 
that data analysts run on the data. 
The data analysts will run lower than 10 total queries each day. The company generates 3 GB of 
new data daily in an on-premises relational database. This data needs to be transferred to AWS 
to perform reporting tasks. 
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements at the LOWEST cost? 
 
A. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to replicate the data from the on-premises 
database into Amazon S3. 
Use Amazon Athena to query the data. 
B. Use an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to deliver the data into an Amazon 
Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) cluster Run the queries in Amazon ES. 
C. Export a daily copy of the data from the on-premises database. 
Use an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway to store and copy the export into Amazon S3. 
Use an Amazon EMR cluster to query the data. 
D. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to replicate the data from the on-premises 
database and load it into an Amazon Redshift cluster. 
Use the Amazon Redshift cluster to query the data. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Target.Redshift.html 
AWS DMS cannot migrate or replicate changes to a schema with a name that begins with 
underscore (_). If you have schemas that have a name that begins with an underscore, use 
mapping transformations to rename the schema on the target.

Amazon Redshift doesn't support VARCHARs larger than 64 KB. LOBs from traditional 
databases can't be stored in Amazon Redshift. 
Applying a DELETE statement to a table with a multi-column primary key is not supported when 
any of the primary key column names use a reserved word. Go here to see a list of Amazon 
Redshift reserved words. 
You may experience performance issues if your source system performs UPDATE operations on 
the primary key of a source table. These performance issues occur when applying changes to the 
target. This is because UPDATE (and DELETE) operations depend on the primary key value to 
identify the target row. If you update the primary key of a source table, your task log will contain 
messages like the following: 
Update on table 1 changes PK to a PK that was previously updated in the same bulk update. 
DMS doesn't support custom DNS names when configuring an endpoint for a Redshift cluster, 
and you need to use the Amazon provided DNS name. Since the Amazon Redshift cluster must 
be in the same AWS account and Region as the replication instance, validation fails if you use a 
custom DNS endpoint. 
 
 
QUESTION 100 
A company wants to monitor its AWS costs for financial review. The cloud operations team is 
designing an architecture in the AWS Organizations management account to query AWS Cost 
and Usage Reports for all member accounts.

Deliver the reports to Amazon S3. 
Use Amazon Redshift for analysis. 
D. Enable Cost and Usage Reports for member accounts. 
Deliver the reports to Amazon Kinesis. 
Use Amazon QuickSight for analysis. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html 
If you are an administrator of an AWS Organizations management account and do not want any 
of the member accounts in your Organization to set-up a CUR you can do one of the following: 
(Recommended) If you've opted into Organizations with all features enabled, you can apply a 
Service Control Policy (SCP). Note that SCPs only apply to member accounts and if you want to 
restrict any IAM users associated with the management account from setting up a CUR, you'll 
need to adjust their specific IAM permissions. SCPs also are not retroactive, so they will not de-
activate any CURs a member account may have set-up prior to the SCP being applied. 
Submit a customer support case to block access to billing data in the Billing console for member 
accounts. This is a list of organizations where the payer account prevents member accounts in its 
organization from viewing billing data on the Bills and Invoices pages. This also prevents those 
accounts from setting up Cost and Usage Reports. This option is only available for organizations 
without all features enabled. Please note that if you have already opted into this to prevent 
member accounts from viewing bills and invoices in the Billing Console, you do not need to 
request this access again. Those same member accounts will also be prevented from setting up a 
Cost and Usage Report.

QUESTION 101 
A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across 
multiple continents. The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 
500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection. 
The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a 
single Amazon S3 bucket. The solution must minimize operational complexity. 
Which solution meets these requirements? 
 
A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket.  
Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket. 
B. Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region.  
Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.  
Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket. 
C. Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each 
site to the closest Region.  
Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket. 
D. Upload the data from each site to an Amazon EC2 instance in the closest Region.  
Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume.  
At regular intervals, take an EBS snapshot and copy it to the Region that contains the 
destination S3 bucket.  
Restore the EBS volume in that Region. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
You might want to use Transfer Acceleration on a bucket for various reasons, including the 
following: 
- You have customers that upload to a centralized bucket from all over the world. 
- You transfer gigabytes to terabytes of data on a regular basis across continents. 
- You are unable to utilize all of your available bandwidth over the Internet when uploading to 
Amazon S3.

QUESTION 104 
An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. The application processes logs that 
are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without 
connectivity to the internet. 
Which solution will provide private network connectivity to Amazon S3? 
 
A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket. 
B. Stream the logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export the logs to the S3 bucket. 
C. Create an instance profile on Amazon EC2 to allow S3 access. 
D. Create an Amazon API Gateway API with a private link to access the S3 endpoint. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
You can access Amazon S3 from your VPC using gateway VPC endpoints. After you create the 
gateway endpoint, you can add it as a target in your route table for traffic destined from your VPC 
to Amazon S3. 
You can create a policy that restricts access to specific IP address ranges by using the 
aws:VpcSourceIp condition key.

QUESTION 105 
A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores 
user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. For better scalability and availability, the 
company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in 
another Availability Zone, placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this 
change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they could see one subset of 
their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time. 
What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once? 
 
A. Copy the data so both EBS volumes contain all the documents. 
B. Configure the Application Load Balancer to direct a user to the server with the documents 
C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS.  
Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS 
D. Configure the Application Load Balancer to send the request to both servers.  
Return each document from the correct server. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Amazon EFS provides file storage in the AWS Cloud. With Amazon EFS, you can create a file 
system, mount the file system on an Amazon EC2 instance, and then read and write data to and 
from your file system. You can mount an Amazon EFS file system in your VPC, through the 
Network File System versions 4.0 and 4.1 (NFSv4) protocol. We recommend using a current 
generation Linux NFSv4.1 client, such as those found in the latest Amazon Linux, Redhat, and 
Ubuntu AMIs, in conjunction with the Amazon EFS Mount Helper. For instructions, see Using the 
amazon-efs-utils Tools. 
For a list of Amazon EC2 Linux Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that support this protocol, see 
NFS Support. For some AMIs, you'll need to install an NFS client to mount your file system on 
your Amazon EC2 instance. For instructions, see Installing the NFS Client. You can access your 
Amazon EFS file system concurrently from multiple NFS clients, so applications that scale 
beyond a single connection can access a file system. Amazon EC2 instances running in multiple 
Availability Zones within the same AWS Region can access the file system, so that many users 
can access and share a common data source.

QUESTION 106 
A company uses NFS to store large video files in on-premises network attached storage. Each 
video file ranges in size from 1 MB to 500 GB. The total storage is 70 TB and is no longer 
growing. The company decides to migrate the video files to Amazon S3. The company must 
migrate the video files as soon as possible while using the least possible network bandwidth. 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Create an S3 bucket. 
Create an IAM role that has permissions to write to the S3 bucket.  
Use the AWS CLI to copy all files locally to the S3 bucket. 
B. Create an AWS Snowball Edge job.  
Receive a Snowball Edge device on premises.  
Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device.  
Return the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3. 
C. Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises.  
Create a public service endpoint to connect to the S3 File Gateway. 
Create an S3 bucket. 
Create a new NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway. 
Point the new file share to the S3 bucket.  
Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway. 
D. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises network and AWS.  
Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises.  
Create a public virtual interlace (VIF) to connect to the S3 File Gateway. 
Create an S3 bucket.  
Create a new NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway.  
Point the new file share to the S3 bucket.  
Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Option B: As using the least possible network bandwidth. 
On a Snowball Edge device you can copy files with a speed of up to 100 Gbps. 70 TB will take 
around 5600 seconds, so very quickly, less than 2 hours. The downside is that it'll take between 
4-6 working days to receive the device and then another 2-3 working days to send it back and for 
AWS to move the data onto S3 once it reaches them. Total time: 6-9 working days. Bandwidth 
used: 0.

QUESTION 108 
A company is migrating a distributed application to AWS. The application serves variable 
workloads. The legacy platform consists of a primary server that coordinates jobs across multiple 
compute nodes. The company wants to modernize the application with a solution that maximizes 
resiliency and scalability. 
How should a solutions architect design the architecture to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the 
jobs. 
Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto 
Scaling group.  
Configure EC2 Auto Scaling to use scheduled scaling. 
B. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the 
jobs. 
Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 Instances that are managed in an Auto 
Scaling group. 
Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue. 
C. Implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are 
managed in an Auto Scaling group. 
Configure AWS CloudTrail as a destination for the fobs . 
Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the primary server. 
D. implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are 
managed in an Auto Scaling group. 
Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) as a destination for the jobs. 
Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the compute nodes. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queue service that enables you to decouple and scale 
microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. By using SQS as the destination 
for the jobs, you can decouple the primary server from the compute nodes, which will increase 
resiliency and scalability. 
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is a service that automatically increases or decreases the number of 
EC2 instances in your application based on demand. By configuring EC2 Auto Scaling to scale 
based on the size of the SQS queue, you can ensure that the number of compute nodes is 
sufficient to handle the workload.

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Finally, you need a way to instruct CloudFormation to complete stack creation only after all the 
services (such as Apache and MySQL) are running and not after all the stack resources are 
created. In other words, if you use the template from the earlier section to launch a stack, 
CloudFormation sets the status of the stack as CREATE_COMPLETE after it successfully 
creates all the resources. However, if one or more services failed to start, CloudFormation still 
sets the stack status as CREATE_COMPLETE. To prevent the status from changing to 
CREATE_COMPLETE until all the services have successfully started, you can add a 
CreationPolicy attribute to the instance. This attribute puts the instance's status in 
CREATE_IN_PROGRESS until CloudFormation receives the required number of success signals 
or the timeout period is exceeded, so you can control when the instance has been successfully 
created.

Add AWS Single Sign-On to AWS Directory Service. 
D. Create a new organization in AWS Organizations. 
Configure the organization's authentication mechanism to use AWS Directory Service directly. 
E. Set up AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) in the organization. 
Configure AWS SSO and integrate it with the company's corporate directory service. 
 
Answer: BC 
Explanation: 
SCPs affect only IAM users and roles that are managed by accounts that are part of the 
organization. SCPs don't affect resource-based policies directly. They also don't affect users or 
roles from accounts outside the organization. For example, consider an Amazon S3 bucket that's 
owned by account A in an organization. The bucket policy (a resource-based policy) grants 
access to users from account B outside the organization. Account A has an SCP attached. That 
SCP doesn't apply to those outside users in account B. The SCP applies only to users that are 
managed by account A in the organization. 
 
An SCP restricts permissions for IAM users and roles in member accounts, including the member 
account's root user. Any account has only those permissions permitted by every parent above it. 
If a permission is blocked at any level above the account, either implicitly (by not being included 
in an Allow policy statement) or explicitly (by being included in a Deny policy statement), a user or 
role in the affected account can't use that permission, even if the account administrator attaches 
the AdministratorAccess IAM policy with */* permissions to the user.

A. Create an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances. 
B. Configure AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances. 
C. Schedule an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 
instances. 
D. Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to 
all EC2 instances. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
For Linux-based operating system types that report a severity level for patches, Patch Manager 
uses the severity level reported by the software publisher for the update notice or individual 
patch. Patch Manager doesn't derive severity levels from third-party sources, such as the 
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), or from metrics released by the National 
Vulnerability Database (NVD).

QUESTION 128 
A solutions architect is developing a multiple-subnet VPC architecture. The solution will consist of 
six subnets in two Availability Zones. The subnets are defined as public, private and dedicated for 
databases. Only the Amazon EC2 instances running in the private subnets should be able to 
access a database. 
Which solution meets these requirements? 
 
A. Create a now route table that excludes the route to the public subnets' CIDR blocks.  
Associate the route table to the database subnets. 
B. Create a security group that denies ingress from the security group used by instances in the 
public subnets.  
Attach the security group to an Amazon RDS DB instance. 
C. Create a security group that allows ingress from the security group used by instances in the 
private subnets.  
Attach the security group to an Amazon RDS DB instance. 
D. Create a new peering connection between the public subnets and the private subnets.  
Create a different peering connection between the private subnets and the database subnets. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Security groups are stateful. All inbound traffic is blocked by default. If you create an inbound rule 
allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again. You cannot block specific IP 
address using Security groups (instead use Network Access Control Lists). 
 
"You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules." "When you first create a security group, it has 
no inbound rules. Therefore, no inbound traffic originating from another host to your instance is 
allowed until you add inbound rules to the security group."

QUESTION 133 
A company is running a multi-tier ecommerce web application in the AWS Cloud. 
The web application is running on Amazon EC2 instances. 
The database tier Is on a provisioned Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster with a writer and a 
reader in a Multi-AZ environment. 
The new requirement for the database tier is to serve the application to achieve continuous write 
availability through an Instance failover. 
What should a solutions architect do to meet this new requirement? 
 
A. Add a new AWS Region to the DB cluster for multiple writes 
B. Add a new reader In the same Availability Zone as the writer. 
C. Migrate the database tier to an Aurora multi-master cluster. 
D. Migrate the database tier to an Aurora DB cluster with parallel query enabled. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Bring-your-own-shard (BYOS) 
A situation where you already have a database schema and associated applications that use 
sharding. You can transfer such deployments relatively easily to Aurora multi-master clusters. In 
this case, you can devote your effort to investigating the Aurora benefits such as server 
consolidation and high availability. You don't need to create new application logic to handle 
multiple connections for write requests.

state of the data. By default, the data seen by a read operation in a multi-master cluster is subject 
to replication lag, typically a few milliseconds. During this brief interval, a query on one DB 
instance might retrieve stale data if the same data is modified at the same time by a different DB 
instance. To enable this setting, change aurora_mm_session_consistency_level from its default 
setting of INSTANCE_RAW to REGIONAL_RAW. Doing so ensures cluster-wide consistency for 
read operations regardless of the DB instances that perform the reads and writes.

QUESTION 134 
A solutions architect observes that a nightly batch processing job is automatically scaled up for 1 
hour before the desired Amazon EC2 capacity is reached. The peak capacity is the ‘same every 
night and the batch jobs always start at 1 AM. The solutions architect needs to find a cost-
effective solution that will allow for the desired EC2 capacity to be reached quickly and allow the 
Auto Scaling group to scale down after the batch jobs are complete. 
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Increase the minimum capacity for the Auto Scaling group. 
B. Increase the maximum capacity for the Auto Scaling group. 
C. Configure scheduled scaling to scale up to the desired compute level. 
D. Change the scaling policy to add more EC2 instances during each scaling operation. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
By configuring scheduled scaling, the solutions architect can set the Auto Scaling group to 
automatically scale up to the desired compute level at a specific time (IAM) when the batch job 
starts and then automatically scale down after the job is complete. This will allow the desired EC2 
capacity to be reached quickly and also help in reducing the cost. 
 
 
QUESTION 135 
A company runs an application in the AWS Cloud and uses Amazon DynamoDB as the database. 
The company deploys Amazon EC2 instances to a private network to process data from the 
database. 
The company uses two NAT instances to provide connectivity to DynamoDB. 
The company wants to retire the NAT instances. 
A solutions architect must implement a solution that provides connectivity to DynamoDB and that 
does not require ongoing management. 
What is the MOST cost-effective solution that meets these requirements? 
 
A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to provide connectivity to DynamoDB 
B. Configure a managed NAT gateway to provide connectivity to DynamoDB 
C. Establish an AWS Direct Connect connection between the private network and DynamoDB 
D. Deploy an AWS PrivateLink endpoint service between the private network and DynamoDB 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
AWS recommends changing from NAT Gateway to VPC endpoints to access S3 or DynamoDB. 
"Determine whether the majority of your NAT gateway charges are from traffic to Amazon Simple 
Storage Service or Amazon DynamoDB in the same Region. If they are, set up a gateway VPC 
endpoint. Route traffic to and from the AWS resource through the gateway VPC endpoint, rather 
than through the NAT gateway. There's no data processing or hourly charges for using gateway 
VPC endpoints."

QUESTION 137 
A company has an automobile sales website that stores its listings in an database on Amazon 
RDS. 
When an automobile is sold, the listing needs to be removed from the website and the data must 
be sent to multiple target systems. 
Which design should a solutions architect recommend? 
 
A. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to 
send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) queue for the targets 
to consume. 
B. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to 
send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue for the 
targets to consume. 
C. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon 
SQS) queue fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. 
Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets. 
D. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Notification Service 
(Amazon SNS) topic fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) 
queues. 
Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
You can use AWS Lambda to process event notifications from an Amazon Relational Database 
Service (Amazon RDS) database. Amazon RDS sends notifications to an Amazon Simple 
Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic, which you can configure to invoke a Lambda function. 
Amazon SNS wraps the message from Amazon RDS in its own event document and sends it to 
your function.

QUESTION 138 
A company is developing a video conversion application hosted on AWS. 
The application will be available in two tiers: a free tier and a paid tier. 
Users in the paid tier will have their videos converted first and then the tree tier users will have 
their videos converted. 
Which solution meets these requirements and is MOST cost-effective? 
 
A. One FIFO queue for the paid tier and one standard queue for the free tier 
B. A single FIFO Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for all file types 
C. A single standard Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for all file types 
D. Two standard Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues with one for the paid tier 
and one for the free tier 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
In AWS, the queue service is the Simple Queue Service (SQS). Multiple SQS queues may be 
prepared to prepare queues for individual priority levels (with a priority queue and a secondary 
queue). Moreover, you may also use the message Delayed Send function to delay process 
execution. 
 
 
QUESTION 139 
A company runs an ecommerce application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application 
Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple 
Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales based on CPU utilization metrics. The 
ecommerce application stores the transaction data in a MySQL 8.0 database that is hosted on a 
large EC2 instance.

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
S3 Intelligent-Tiering -Perfect use case when you don't know the frequency of access or irregular 
patterns of usage. 
Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases. These include S3 
Standard for general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data; S3 Intelligent-Tiering for data 
with unknown or changing access patterns; S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and 
S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) for long-lived, but less frequently accessed 
data; and Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier 
Deep Archive) for long-term archive and digital preservation. If you have data residency 
requirements that can't be met by an existing AWS Region, you can use the S3 Outposts storage 
class to store your S3 data on-premises. Amazon S3 also offers capabilities to manage your data 
throughout its lifecycle. Once an S3 Lifecycle policy is set, your data will automatically transfer to 
a different storage class without any changes to your application.

QUESTION 154 
A company is designing an application where users upload small files into Amazon S3.  
After a user uploads a file, the file requires one-time simple processing to transform the data and 
save the data in JSON format for later analysis. 
 
Each file must be processed as quickly as possible after it is uploaded. Demand will vary.  
On some days, users will upload a high number of files. On other days, users will upload a few 
files or no files. 
 
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 
 
A. Configure Amazon EMR to read text files from Amazon S3.  
Run processing scripts to transform the data.  
Store the resulting JSON file in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster. 
B. Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service 
(Amazon SQS) queue.  
Use Amazon EC2 instances to read from the queue and process the data.  
Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB. 
C. Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service 
(Amazon SQS) queue.  
Use an AWS Lambda function to read from the queue and process the data.  
Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB. 
D. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send an event to Amazon 
Kinesis Data Streams when a new file is uploaded.  
Use an AWS Lambda function to consume the event from the stream and process the data.  
Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon Aurora DB cluster. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Amazon S3 sends event notifications about S3 buckets (for example, object created, object 
removed, or object restored) to an SNS topic in the same Region. 
The SNS topic publishes the event to an SQS queue in the central Region. 
The SQS queue is configured as the event source for your Lambda function and buffers the event 
messages for the Lambda function. 
The Lambda function polls the SQS queue for messages and processes the Amazon S3 event 
notifications according to your application's requirements.

B. Users can terminate an EC2 instance with the IP address 10 100 100 1 in the us-east-1 Region 
C. Users can terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 
10.100.100.254. 
D. Users cannot terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 
10.100 100 254 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
As the policy prevents anyone from doing any EC2 action on any region except us-east-1 and 
allows only users with source ip 10.100.100.0/24 to terminate instances. So user with source ip 
10.100.100.254 can terminate instances in us-east-1 region.

C. Increase the visibility timeout in the SQS queue to a value that is greater than the total of the 
function timeout and the batch window timeout. 
D. Modify the Lambda function to delete each message from the SQS queue immediately after the 
message is read before processing. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Immediately after a message is received, it remains in the queue. To prevent other consumers 
from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a visibility timeout, a period of time during 
which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message. The 
default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum 
is 12 hours.

D. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key.  
Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations.  
Store the encrypted data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
S3 is highly available with LEAST operational overhead. 
Amazon S3 provides durability by redundantly storing the data across multiple Availability Zones 
whereas EBS provides durability by redundantly storing the data in a single Availability Zone. 
Both S3 and EBS gives the availability of 99.99%, but the only difference that occurs is that S3 is 
accessed via the internet using API’s and EBS is accessed by the single instance attached to 
EBS. 
 
 
QUESTION 161 
A solutions architect is designing a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC and subnets 
use IPv4 CIDR blocks. There is one public subnet and one private subnet in each of three 
Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. An internet gateway is used to provide internet 
access for the public subnets. The private subnets require access to the internet to allow Amazon 
EC2 instances to download software updates. 
 
What should the solutions architect do to enable Internet access for the private subnets? 
 
A. Create three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each AZ.  
Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT gateway in its 
AZ. 
B. Create three NAT instances, one for each private subnet in each AZ.  
Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT instance in its 
AZ. 
C. Create a second internet gateway on one of the private subnets.  
Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the private internet 
gateway. 
D. Create an egress-only internet gateway on one of the public subnets.  
Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the egress-only 
internet gateway. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
To enable Internet access for the private subnets, the solutions architect should create three NAT 
gateways, one for each public subnet in each Availability Zone (AZ). NAT gateways allow private 
instances to initiate outbound traffic to the Internet but do not allow inbound traffic from the 
Internet to reach the private instances. 
The solutions architect should then create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-
VPC traffic to the NAT gateway in its AZ. This will allow instances in the private subnets to access 
the Internet through the NAT gateways in the public subnets.

QUESTION 163 
A company has an AWS Glue extract. transform, and load (ETL) job that runs every day at the 
same time. The job processes XML data that is in an Amazon S3 bucket. New data is added to 
the S3 bucket every day. A solutions architect notices that AWS Glue is processing all the data 
during each run. 
What should the solutions architect do to prevent AWS Glue from reprocessing old data? 
 
A. Edit the job to use job bookmarks. 
B. Edit the job to delete data after the data is processed 
C. Edit the job by setting the NumberOfWorkers field to 1.

QUESTION 165 
A company is preparing to deploy a new serverless workload.  
A solutions architect must use the principle of least privilege to configure permissions that will be 
used to run an AWS Lambda function.  
An Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule will invoke the function. 
 
Which solution meets these requirements? 
 
A. Add an execution role to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and * as the 
principal. 
B. Add an execution role to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and 
Service:amazonaws.com as the principal. 
C. Add a resource-based policy to the function with lambda:'* as the action and 
Service:events.amazonaws.com as the principal. 
D. Add a resource-based policy to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and 
Service:events.amazonaws.com as the principal. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
The principle of least privilege requires that permissions are granted only to the minimum 
necessary to perform a task. In this case, the Lambda function needs to be able to be invoked by 
Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events). To meet these requirements, you can add a 
resource-based policy to the function that allows the InvokeFunction action to be performed by 
the Service: events.amazonaws.com principal. This will allow Amazon EventBridge to invoke the 
function, but will not grant any additional permissions to the function.

QUESTION 180 
A development team needs to host a website that will be accessed by other teams. The website 
contents consist of HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript, and images. 
Which method is the MOST cost-effective for hosting the website? 
 
A. Containerize the website and host it in AWS Fargate. 
B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket and host the website there 
C. Deploy a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance to host the website. 
D. Configure an Application Loa d Balancer with an AWS Lambda target that uses the Express js 
framework. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
In Static Websites, Web pages are returned by the server which are prebuilt. 
They use simple languages such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. 
There is no processing of content on the server (according to the user) in Static Websites. Web 
pages are returned by the server with no change therefore, static Websites are fast. 
There is no interaction with databases. 
Also, they are less costly as the host does not need to support server-side processing with 
different languages. 
============ 
In Dynamic Websites, Web pages are returned by the server which are processed during runtime 
means they are not prebuilt web pages but they are built during runtime according to the user's 
demand. 
These use server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Node.js, ASP.NET and many more 
supported by the server. 
So, they are slower than static websites but updates and interaction with databases are possible.

QUESTION 185 
A company is using a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances to ingest data from on-premises data 
sources. The data is in JSON format and ingestion rates can be as high as 1 MB/s. When an EC2 
instance is rebooted, the data in-flight is lost. 
 
The company's data science team wants to query ingested data near-real time. 
 
Which solution provides near-real-time data querying that is scalable with minimal data loss? 
 
A. Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. 
Use Kinesis Data Analytics to query the data. 
B. Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Amazon Redshift as the destination. 
Use Amazon Redshift to query the data. 
C. Store ingested data in an EC2 instance store. 
Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Amazon S3 as the destination. 
Use Amazon Athena to query the data. 
D. Store ingested data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. 
Publish data to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis. 
Subscribe to the Redis channel to query the data. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Kinesis data streams consists of shards. The more througput is needed, the more shards you 
add, the less throughput, the more shards you remove, so it's scalable. Each shard can handle 
up to 1MB/s of writes. 
However Kinesis data streams stores ingested data for only 1 to 7 days so there is a chance of 
data loss. Additionally, 
Kinesis data analytics and kinesis data streams are both for real-time ingestion and analytics. 
Firehouse on the other hand is also scalable and processes data in near real time as per the 
requirement. It also transfers data into Redshift which is a data warehouse so data won't be lost. 
Redshift also has a SQL interface for performing queries for data analytics.

too high. 
D. Set up AWS Auto Scaling to scale out the ECS service when the ALB target group CPU 
utilization is too high. 
Set up AWS Auto Scaling to scale out the ECS cluster when the CPU or memory reservation is 
too high. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Match deployed capacity to the incoming application load, using scaling policies for both the ECS 
service and the Auto Scaling group in which the ECS cluster runs. Scaling up cluster instances 
and service tasks when needed and safely scaling them down when demand subsides, keeps 
you out of the capacity guessing game. This provides you high availability with lowered costs in 
the long run.

QUESTION 190 
A company operates an ecommerce website on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application 
Load Balancer (ALB) in an Auto Scaling group. The site is experiencing performance issues 
related to a high request rate from illegitimate external systems with changing IP addresses. The 
security team is worried about potential DDoS attacks against the website. The company must 
block the illegitimate incoming requests in a way that has a minimal impact on legitimate users. 
 
What should a solutions architect recommend? 
 
A. Deploy Amazon Inspector and associate it with the ALB. 
B. Deploy AWS WAF, associate it with the ALB, and configure a rate-limiting rule. 
C. Deploy rules to the network ACLs associated with the ALB to block the incoming traffic. 
D. Deploy Amazon GuardDuty and enable rate-limiting protection when configuring GuardDuty. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Rate limit 
For a rate-based rule, enter the maximum number of requests to allow in any five-minute period 
from an IP address that matches the rule's conditions. The rate limit must be at least 100. 
 
You can specify a rate limit alone, or a rate limit and conditions. If you specify only a rate limit,

102 
AWS WAF places the limit on all IP addresses. If you specify a rate limit and conditions, AWS 
WAF places the limit on IP addresses that match the conditions. 
 
When an IP address reaches the rate limit threshold, AWS WAF applies the assigned action 
(block or count) as quickly as possible, usually within 30 seconds. Once the action is in place, if 
five minutes pass with no requests from the IP address, AWS WAF resets the counter to zero.

QUESTION 194 
An application runs on Amazon EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones. The instances 
run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer. The application 
performs best when the CPU utilization of the EC2 instances is at or near 40%.  
What should a solutions architect do to maintain the desired performance across all instances in 
the group? 
 
A. Use a simple scaling policy to dynamically scale the Auto Scaling group 
B. Use a target tracking policy to dynamically scale the Auto Scaling group 
C. Use an AWS Lambda function to update the desired Auto Scaling group capacity. 
D. Use scheduled scaling actions to scale up and scale down the Auto Scaling group 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
With a target tracking scaling policy, you can increase or decrease the current capacity of the 
group based on a target value for a specific metric. This policy will help resolve the over-
provisioning of your resources. The scaling policy adds or removes capacity as required to keep 
the metric at, or close to, the specified target value. In addition to keeping the metric close to the 
target value, a target tracking scaling policy also adjusts to changes in the metric due to a 
changing load pattern.

QUESTION 198 
A company wants to move its application to a serverless solution. The serverless solution needs 
to analyze existing and new data by using SQL. The company stores the data in an Amazon S3 
bucket. The data requires encryption and must be replicated to a different AWS Region. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 
 
A. Create a new S3 bucket. Load the data into the new S3 bucket.  
Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in 
another Region.  
Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region kays (SSE-KMS).  
Use Amazon Athena to query the data. 
B. Create a new S3 bucket. Load the data into the new S3 bucket.  
Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in 
another Region.  
Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region keys (SSE-KMS).  
Use Amazon RDS to query the data. 
C. Load the data into the existing S3 bucket. 
Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in 
another Region.  
Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3).  
Use Amazon Athena to query the data. 
D. Load the data into the existing S3 bucket. 
Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in 
another Region.  
Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3).  
Use Amazon RDS to query the data. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Amazon S3 Bucket Keys reduce the cost of Amazon S3 server-side encryption using AWS Key 
Management Service (SSE-KMS). This new bucket-level key for SSE can reduce AWS KMS 
request costs by up to 99 percent by decreasing the request traffic from Amazon S3 to AWS 
KMS. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, and without any changes to your client 
applications, you can configure your bucket to use an S3 Bucket Key for AWS KMS-based 
encryption on new objects. 
The Existing S3 bucket might have uncrypted data - encryption will apply new data received after 
the applying of encryption on the new bucket.

QUESTION 227 
A company has an AWS account used for software engineering. The AWS account has access to 
the company's on-premises data center through a pair of AWS Direct Connect connections. All 
non-VPC traffic routes to the virtual private gateway. 
A development team recently created an AWS Lambda function through the console. 
The development team needs to allow the function to access a database that runs in a private 
subnet in the company's data center. 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Configure the Lambda function to run in the VPC with the appropriate security group. 
B. Set up a VPN connection from AWS to the data center. Route the traffic from the Lambda 
function through the VPN. 
C. Update the route tables in the VPC to allow the Lambda function to access the on-premises data 
center through Direct Connect. 
D. Create an Elastic IP address. Configure the Lambda function to send traffic through the Elastic IP 
address without an elastic network interface. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
To connect to another AWS service, you can use VPC endpoints for private communications 
between your VPC and supported AWS services. An alternative approach is to use a NAT 
gateway to route outbound traffic to another AWS service. 
To give your function access to the internet, route outbound traffic to a NAT gateway in a public 
subnet. The NAT gateway has a public IP address and can connect to the internet through the 
VPC's internet gateway.

QUESTION 236 
An application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. The application needs to 
access an Amazon DynamoDB table. What is the MOST secure way to access the table while 
ensuring that the traffic does not leave the AWS network? 
 
A. Use a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB. 
B. Use a NAT gateway in a public subnet. 
C. Use a NAT instance in a private subnet. 
D. Use the internet gateway attached to the VPC. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/vpc-endpoints-
dynamodb.html 
A VPC endpoint for DynamoDB enables Amazon EC2 instances in your VPC to use their private 
IP addresses to access DynamoDB with no exposure to the public internet. Your EC2 instances 
do not require public IP addresses, and you don't need an internet gateway, a NAT device, or a 
virtual private gateway in your VPC. You use endpoint policies to control access to DynamoDB. 
Traffic between your VPC and the AWS service does not leave the Amazon network.

QUESTION 240 
A solutions architect is designing the architecture of a new application being deployed to the AWS 
Cloud. The application will run on Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances and will automatically 
scale across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances will scale up and down frequently 
throughout the day. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) will handle the load distribution. The 
architecture needs to support distributed session data management. The company is willing to 
make changes to code if needed. 
What should the solutions architect do to ensure that the architecture supports distributed session 
data management? 
 
A. Use Amazon ElastiCache to manage and store session data. 
B. Use session affinity (sticky sessions) of the ALB to manage session data. 
C. Use Session Manager from AWS Systems Manager to manage the session. 
D. Use the GetSessionToken API operation in AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to manage 
the session 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
https://aws.amazon.com/vi/caching/session-management/ 
In order to address scalability and to provide a shared data storage for sessions that can be 
accessible from any individual web server, you can abstract the HTTP sessions from the web 
servers themselves. A common solution to for this is to leverage an In-Memory Key/Value store 
such as Redis and Memcached. ElastiCache offerings for In-Memory key/value stores include 
ElastiCache for Redis, which can support replication, and ElastiCache for Memcached which 
does not support replication.

QUESTION 247 
A company runs an application on a large fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. The application reads 
and write entries into an Amazon DynamoDB table. The size of the DynamoDB table continuously 
grows, but the application needs only data from the last 30 days. The company needs a solution 
that minimizes cost and development effort. 
Which solution meets these requirements? 
 
A. Use an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy the complete solution.  
Redeploy the CloudFormation stack every 30 days, and delete the original stack. 
B. Use an EC2 instance that runs a monitoring application from AWS Marketplace.  
Configure the monitoring application to use Amazon DynamoDB Streams to store the timestamp 
when a new item is created in the table.  
Use a script that runs on the EC2 instance to delete items that have a timestamp that is older 
than 30 days. 
C. Configure Amazon DynamoDB Streams to invoke an AWS Lambda function when a new item is 
created in the table.  
Configure the Lambda function to delete items in the table that are older than 30 days. 
D. Extend the application to add an attribute that has a value of the current timestamp plus 30 days 
to each new item that is created in the table.  
Configure DynamoDB to use the attribute as the TTL attribute. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Amazon DynamoDB Time to Live (TTL) allows you to define a per-item timestamp to determine 
when an item is no longer needed. Shortly after the date and time of the specified timestamp, 
DynamoDB deletes the item from your table without consuming any write throughput. TTL is

provided at no extra cost as a means to reduce stored data volumes by retaining only the items 
that remain current for your workload's needs. 
TTL is useful if you store items that lose relevance after a specific time. The following are 
example TTL use cases: 
- Remove user or sensor data after one year of inactivity in an application. 
- Archive expired items to an Amazon S3 data lake via Amazon DynamoDB Streams and AWS 
Lambda. 
- Retain sensitive data for a certain amount of time according to contractual or regulatory 
obligations.

cluster that is configured with the Amazon EC2 launch type.  
Use the container to process the SQS messages.  
Store the results on an Amazon RDS DB instance. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
By placing the JSON documents in an S3 bucket, the documents will be stored in a highly durable 
and scalable object storage service. The use of AWS Lambda allows the company to run their 
Python code to process the documents as they arrive in the S3 bucket without having to worry 
about the underlying infrastructure. This also allows for horizontal scalability, as AWS Lambda will 
automatically scale the number of instances of the function based on the incoming rate of 
requests. The results can be stored in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, which is a fully-managed, 
high-performance database service that is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. This will 
provide the necessary durability and scalability for the results of the processing.

QUESTION 257 
You have been given a scope to deploy some AWS infrastructure for a large organisation. The 
requirements are that you will have a lot of EC2 instances but may need to add more when the 
average utilization of your Amazon EC2 fleet is high and conversely remove them when CPU 
utilization is low. Which AWS services would be best to use to accomplish this? 
 
A. Auto Scaling, Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
B. Auto Scaling, Amazon CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing. 
C. Amazon CloudFront, Amazon CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing. 
D. AWS Elastic Beanstalk , Amazon CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Auto Scaling enables you to follow the demand curve for your applications closely, reducing the 
need to manually provision Amazon EC2 capacity in advance. For example, you can set a 
condition to add new Amazon EC2 instances in increments to the Auto Scaling group when the 
average utilization of your Amazon EC2 fleet is high; and similarly, you can set a condition to 
remove instances in the same increments when CPU utilization is low. If you have predictable 
load changes, you can set a schedule through Auto Scaling to plan your scaling activities. You 
can use Amazon CloudWatch to send alarms to trigger scaling activities and Elastic Load 
Balancing to help distribute traffic to your instances within Auto Scaling groups. Auto Scaling 
enables you to run your Amazon EC2 fleet at optimal utilization.

QUESTION 258 
Which of the below mentioned options is not available when an instance is launched by Auto 
Scaling with EC2 Classic? 
 
A. Public IP 
B. Elastic IP 
C. Private DNS 
D. Private IP 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Auto Scaling supports both EC2 classic and EC2-VPC. When an instance is launched as a part of 
EC2 classic, it will have the public IP and DNS as well as the private IP and DNS.

A. Detach a volume on an EC2 instance and copy it to Amazon S3 
B. Launch a new EC2 instance from an Amazon Machine image (AMI) in a new Region 
C. Launch a new EC2 instance in a new Region and copy a volume from Amazon S3 to the new 
instance 
D. Copy an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of an EC2 instance and specify a different Region for the 
destination 
E. Copy an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume from Amazon S3 and launch an EC2 
instance in the destination Region using that EBS volume 
 
Answer: BD 
Explanation: 
By default, when you create an AMI from an instance, snapshots are taken of each EBS volume 
attached to the instance. AMIs can launch with multiple EBS volumes attached, allowing you to 
replicate both an instance's configuration and the state of all the EBS volumes that are attached 
to that instance.

QUESTION 260 
A recently acquired company is required to buikl its own infrastructure on AWS and migrate 
multiple applications to the cloud within a month. 
Each application has approximately 50 TB of data to be transferred. 
After the migration is complete this company and its parent company will both require secure 
network connectivity with consistent throughput from their data centers to the applications. 
A solutions architect must ensure one-time data migration and ongoing network connectivity. 
Which solution will meet these requirements'' 
 
A. AWS Direct Connect for both the initial transfer and ongoing connectivity 
B. AWS Site-to-Site VPN for both the initial transfer and ongoing connectivity 
C. AWS Snowball for the initial transfer and AWS Direct Connect for ongoing connectivity 
D. AWS Snowball for the initial transfer and AWS Site-to-Site VPN for ongoing connectivity 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
"Each application has approximately 50 TB of data to be transferred" = AWS Snowball; "secure 
network connectivity with consistent throughput from their data centers to the applications" 
What are the benefits of using AWS Direct Connect and private network connections? 
In many circumstances, private network connections can reduce costs, increase bandwidth, and 
provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. "more consistent 
network experience", hence AWS Direct Connect. 
Direct Connect is better than VPN; reduced cost+increased bandwith+(remain connection or 
consistent network) = direct connect 
 
 
QUESTION 261 
Much of your company's data does not need to be accessed often, and can take several hours for 
retrieval time, so it's stored on Amazon Glacier. However someone within your organization has 
expressed concerns that his data is more sensitive than the other data, and is wondering whether 
the high level of encryption that he knows is on S3 is also used on the much cheaper Glacier 
service. Which of the following statements would be most applicable in regards to this concern? 
 
A. There is no encryption on Amazon Glacier, that's why it is cheaper. 
B. Amazon Glacier automatically encrypts the data using AES-128 a lesser encryption method than

Amazon S3 but you can change it to AES-256 if you are willing to pay more. 
C. Amazon Glacier automatically encrypts the data using AES-256, the same as Amazon S3. 
D. Amazon Glacier automatically encrypts the data using AES-128 a lesser encryption method than 
Amazon S3. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Like Amazon S3, the Amazon Glacier service provides low-cost, secure, and durable storage. But 
where S3 is designed for rapid retrieval, Glacier is meant to be used as an archival service for 
data that is not accessed often, and for which retrieval times of several hours are suitable. 
Amazon Glacier automatically encrypts the data using AES-256 and stores it durably in an 
immutable form. Amazon Glacier is designed to provide average annual durability of 
99.999999999% for an archive. It stores each archive in multiple facilities and multiple devices. 
Unlike traditional systems which can require laborious data verification and manual repair, Glacier 
performs regular, systematic data integrity checks, and is built to be automatically self-healing.

QUESTION 262 
Your EBS volumes do not seem to be performing as expected and your team leader has 
requested you look into improving their performance. Which of the following is not a true 
statement relating to the performance of your EBS volumes? 
 
A. Frequent snapshots provide a higher level of data durability and they will not degrade the 
performance of your application while the snapshot is in progress. 
B. General Purpose (SSD) and Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes have a throughput limit of 128 
MB/s per volume. 
C. There is a relationship between the maximum performance of your EBS volumes, the amount of 
I/O you are driving to them, and the amount of time it takes for each transaction to complete. 
D. There is a 5 to 50 percent reduction in IOPS when you first access each block of data on a newly 
created or restored EBS volume 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Several factors can affect the performance of Amazon EBS volumes, such as instance 
configuration, I/O characteristics, workload demand, and storage configuration. Frequent 
snapshots provide a higher level of data durability, but they may slightly degrade the performance 
of your application while the snapshot is in progress. This trade off becomes critical when you 
have data that changes rapidly. Whenever possible, plan for snapshots to occur during off-peak 
times in order to minimize workload impact.

136 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Read Replicas make it easy to take advantage of MySQL's built-in replication functionality to 
elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB Instance for read-heavy 
database workloads. There are a variety of scenarios where deploying one or more Read 
Replicas for a given source DB Instance may make sense. Common reasons for deploying a 
Read Replica include: 
Scaling beyond the compute or I/O capacity of a single DB Instance for read-heavy database 
workloads. This excess read traffic can be directed to one or more Read Replicas. Serving read 
traffic while the source DB Instance is unavailable. If your source DB Instance cannot take I/O 
requests (e.g. due to I/O suspension for backups or scheduled maintenance), you can direct read 
traffic to your Read Replica(s). For this use case, keep in mind that the data on the Read Replica 
may be "stale" since the source DB Instance is unavailable. Business reporting or data 
warehousing scenarios; you may want business reporting queries to run against a Read Replica, 
rather than your primary, production DB Instance.

QUESTION 264 
You've created your first load balancer and have registered your EC2 instances with the load 
balancer. Elastic Load Balancing routinely performs health checks on all the registered EC2 
instances and automatically distributes all incoming requests to the DNS name of your load 
balancer across your registered, healthy EC2 instances. By default, the load balancer uses the 
___ protocol for checking the health of your instances. 
 
A. HTTPS 
B. HTTP 
C. ICMP 
D. IPv6 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
In Elastic Load Balancing a health configuration uses information such as protocol, ping port, ping 
path (URL), response timeout period, and health check interval to determine the health state of 
the instances registered with the load balancer. 
Currently, HTTP on port 80 is the default health check.

Which pricing model should the company choose? 
 
A. Reserved Instances 
B. Spot Block Instances 
C. On-Demand Instances 
D. Scheduled Reserved Instances 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Scheduled Reserved Instances (Scheduled Instances) enable you to purchase capacity 
reservations that recur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, with a specified start time and 
duration, for a one-year term. You reserve the capacity in advance, so that you know it is 
available when you need it. You pay for the time that the instances are scheduled, even if you do 
not use them. 
Scheduled Instances are a good choice for workloads that do not run continuously, but do run on 
a regular schedule. For example, you can use Scheduled Instances for an application that runs 
during business hours or for batch processing that runs at the end of the week.

QUESTION 271 
A company's web application uses an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL DB instance to store its 
application data. 
During the financial closing period at the start of every month. Accountants run large queries that 
impact the database's performance due to high usage. 
The company wants to minimize the impact that the reporting activity has on the web application. 
What should a solutions architect do to reduce the impact on the database with the LEAST 
amount of effort? 
 
A. Create a read replica and direct reporting traffic to the replica. 
B. Create a Multi-AZ database and direct reporting traffic to the standby. 
C. Create a cross-Region read replica and direct reporting traffic to the replica. 
D. Create an Amazon Redshift database and direct reporting traffic to the Amazon Redshift 
database. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Amazon RDS uses the MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server DB 
engines' built-in replication functionality to create a special type of DB instance called a read 
replica from a source DB instance. Updates made to the source DB instance are asynchronously 
copied to the read replica. You can reduce the load on your source DB instance by routing read 
queries from your applications to the read replica.

B seems more expensive; C does not seem right because they are single use files and will not be 
needed again from the cache; D multipart mainly for large files and will not reduce data and cost; 
A seems the best: change the application code to compress the files and reduce the amount of 
data transferred to save costs. 
 
 
QUESTION 279 
An application running on an Amazon EC2 instance in VPC-A needs to access files in another 
EC2 instance in VPC-B. Both are in separate AWS accounts. 
The network administrator needs to design a solution to enable secure access to EC2 instance in 
VPC-B from VPC-A. The connectivity should not have a single point of failure or bandwidth 
concerns. 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Set up a VPC peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-B. 
B. Set up VPC gateway endpoints for the EC2 instance running in VPC-B. 
C. Attach a virtual private gateway to VPC-B and enable routing from VPC-A. 
D. Create a private virtual interface (VIF) for the EC2 instance running in VPC-B and add appropriate 
routes from VPC-B. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to 
route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. Instances in either 
VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. You can create a 
VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. 
The traffic remains in the private IP space. All inter-region traffic is encrypted with no single point 
of failure, or bandwidth bottleneck.

QUESTION 281 
A solutions architect is creating an application that will handle batch processing of large amounts 
of data. The input data will be held in Amazon S3 and the output data will be stored in a different 
S3 bucket. For processing, the application will transfer the data over the network between 
multiple Amazon EC2 instances. 
 
What should the solutions architect do to reduce the overall data transfer costs? 
 
A. Place all the EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. 
B. Place all the EC2 instances in the same AWS Region. 
C. Place all the EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone. 
D. Place all the EC2 instances in private subnets in multiple Availability Zones. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The transfer is between EC2 instances and not just between S3 and EC2. 
Also, be aware of inter-Availability Zones data transfer charges between Amazon EC2 instances, 
even within the same region. If possible, the instances in a development or test environment that 
need to communicate with each other should be co-located within the same Availability Zone to 
avoid data transfer charges. (This doesn't apply to production workloads which will most likely 
need to span multiple Availability Zones for high availability.)

QUESTION 282 
A company has recently updated its internal security standards. 
The company must now ensure all Amazon S3 buckets and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon 
EBS) volumes are encrypted with keys created and periodically rotated by internal security 
specialists. 
The company is looking for a native, software-based AWS service to accomplish this goal. 
What should a solutions architect recommend as a solution? 
 
A. Use AWS Secrets Manager with customer master keys (CMKs) to store master key material and 
apply a routine to create a new CMK periodically and replace it in AWS Secrets Manager. 
B. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) with customer master keys (CMKs) to store 
master key material and apply a routing to re-create a new key periodically and replace it in AWS 
KMS. 
C. Use an AWS CloudHSM cluster with customer master keys (CMKs) to store master key material 
and apply a routine a re-create a new key periodically and replace it in the CloudHSM cluster 
nodes. 
D. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store with customer master keys (CMKs) keys to store 
master key material and apply a routine to re-create a new periodically and replace it in the 
Parameter Store. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
AWS Secrets Manager provides full lifecycle management for secrets within your environment. In 
this post, Maitreya and I will show you how to use Secrets Manager to store, deliver, and rotate 
SSH keypairs used for communication within compute clusters. Rotation of these keypairs is a 
security best practice, and sometimes a regulatory requirement. Traditionally, these keypairs 
have been associated with a number of tough challenges. For example, synchronizing key

QUESTION 283 
An application is running on Amazon EC2 instances Sensitive information required for the 
application is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. 
The bucket needs to be protected from internet access while only allowing services within the 
VPC access to the bucket. 
Which combination of actions should a solutions archived take to accomplish this? (Choose two.) 
 
A. Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. 
B. Enable server access logging on the bucket 
C. Apply a bucket policy to restrict access to the S3 endpoint. 
D. Add an S3 ACL to the bucket that has sensitive information 
E. Restrict users using the IAM policy to use the specific bucket 
 
Answer: AC 
Explanation: 
ACL is a property at object level not at bucket level .Also by just adding ACL you can't let the 
services in VPC allow access to the bucket .

Which solution meets these requirements? 
 
A. Deploy a NAT gateway inside the public subnet for each Availability Zone and associate it with an 
Elastic IP address. 
Update the routing table of the private subnet to use it as the default route. 
B. Deploy a NAT gateway inside the private subnet for each Availability Zone and associate it with 
an Elastic IP address.

C. Deploy two NAT instances inside the public subnet for each Availability Zone and associate them 
with Elastic IP addresses. 
Update the routing table of the private subnet to use it as the default route. 
D. Deploy two NAT instances inside the private subnet for each Availability Zone and associate them 
with Elastic IP addresses. 
Update the routing table of the private subnet to use it as the default route. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
VPC with public and private subnets (NAT) 
The configuration for this scenario includes a virtual private cloud (VPC) with a public subnet and 
a private subnet. We recommend this scenario if you want to run a public-facing web application, 
while maintaining back-end servers that aren't publicly accessible. A common example is a multi-
tier website, with the web servers in a public subnet and the database servers in a private subnet. 
You can set up security and routing so that the web servers can communicate with the database 
servers. 
The instances in the public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the Internet, whereas the 
instances in the private subnet can't. Instead, the instances in the private subnet can access the 
Internet by using a network address translation (NAT) gateway that resides in the public subnet. 
The database servers can connect to the Internet for software updates using the NAT gateway, 
but the Internet cannot establish connections to the database servers.

QUESTION 286 
A company has an on-premises data center that is running out of storage capacity. The company 
wants to migrate its storage infrastructure to AWS while minimizing bandwidth costs. The solution 
must allow for immediate retrieval of data at no additional cost. 
How can these requirements be met? 
 
A. Deploy Amazon S3 Glacier Vault and enable expedited retrieval. 
Enable provisioned retrieval capacity for the workload 
B. Deploy AWS Storage Gateway using cached volumes. 
Use Storage Gateway to store data in Amazon S3 while retaining copies of frequently accessed 
data subsets locally. 
C. Deploy AWS Storage Gateway using stored volumes to store data locally. 
Use Storage Gateway to asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of the data to Amazon 
S3 
D. Deploy AWS Direct Connect to connect with the on-premises data center. 
Configure AWS Storage Gateway to store data locally. 
Use Storage Gateway to asynchronously bacK up potnt-tn-time snapshots of the data to Amazon 
S3. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Volume Gateway provides an iSCSI target, which enables you to create block storage volumes 
and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises or EC2 application servers. The

146 
Volume Gateway runs in either a cached or stored mode: 
In the cached mode, your primary data is written to S3, while retaining your frequently accessed 
data locally in a cache for low-latency access. 
In the stored mode, your primary data is stored locally and your entire dataset is available for low-
latency access while asynchronously backed up to AWS. 
 
 
QUESTION 287 
A company recently implemented hybrid cloud connectivity using AWS Direct Connect and is 
migrating data to Amazon S3. 
The company is looking for a fully managed solution that will automate and accelerate the 
replication of data between the on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services. 
Which solution should a solutions architect recommend to keep the data private? 
 
A. Deploy an AWS DataSync agent tor the on-premises environment. 
Configure a sync job to replicate the data and connect it with an AWS service endpoint. 
B. Deploy an AWS DataSync agent for the on-premises environment. 
Schedule a batch job to replicate point-ln-time snapshots to AWS. 
C. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway for the on-premises environment. 
Configure it to store data locally, and asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots to AWS. 
D. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway for the on-premises environment. 
Configure it to store data locally, and asynchronously back up point-in-lime snapshots to AWS. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
You can use AWS DataSync with your Direct Connect link to access public service endpoints or 
private VPC endpoints. When using VPC endpoints, data transferred between the DataSync 
agent and AWS services does not traverse the public internet or need public IP addresses, 
increasing the security of data as it is copied over the network. 
 
 
QUESTION 288 
A solutions architect is designing the storage architecture for a new web application used for 
stonng and viewing engineering drawings. All application components will be deployed on the 
AWS infrastructure.

Which combination of storage and caching should the solutions architect use? 
 
A. Amazon S3 with Amazon CloudFront 
B. Amazon S3 Glacier with Amazon ElastiCache 
C. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes with Amazon CloudFront 
D. AWS Storage Gateway with Amazon ElastiCache 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
CloudFront for caching and S3 as the origin. Glacier is used for archiving which is not the case for 
this scenario.

D. Run AWS Lambda when a user is modified 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
A new AWS Config rule is deployed in the account after you enable AWS Security Hub. The AWS 
Config rule reacts to resource configuration and compliance changes and send these change 
items to AWS CloudWatch. When AWS CloudWatch receives the compliance change, a 
CloudWatch event rule triggers the AWS Lambda function. 
 
 
QUESTION 290

C. Launch the containers on Amazon Elastic Containers service (Amazon ECS) with AWS Fargate 
instances. 
D. Launch the containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon EC) with Amazon EC2 
instance worker nodes. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
When talking about containerized applications, the leading technologies which will always come 
up during the conversation are Kubernetes and Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service). 
While Kubernetes is an open-sourced container orchestration platform that was originally 
developed by Google, Amazon ECS is AWS' proprietary, managed container orchestration 
service.

Notification Service (Amazon SNS) . 
Have Amazon SNS invoke a custom AWS Lambda function that parses the logs looking for a 
DDoS attack. 
Modify a network ACL to block identified source IP addresses. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps detect and mitigate web application layer DDoS 
attacks by inspecting traffic inline. Application layer DDoS attacks use well-formed but malicious 
requests to evade mitigation and consume application resources. You can define custom security 
rules (also called web ACLs) that contain a set of conditions, rules, and actions to block attacking 
traffic. After you define web ACLs, you can apply them to CloudFront distributions, and web ACLs 
are evaluated in the priority order you specified when you configured them. Real-time metrics and 
sampled web requests are provided for each web ACL.

Answer: D 
Explanation: 
To upload existing data to Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier), you might consider using one of the 
AWS Snowball device types to import data into Amazon S3, and then move it to the S3 Glacier 
storage class for archival using lifecycle rules. When you transition Amazon S3 objects to the S3 
Glacier storage class, Amazon S3 internally uses S3 Glacier for durable storage at lower cost. 
Although the objects are stored in S3 Glacier, they remain Amazon S3 objects that you manage 
in Amazon S3, and you cannot access them directly through S3 Glacier.

QUESTION 296 
A company's website handles millions of requests each day, and the number of requests 
continues to increase. A solutions architect needs to improve the response time of the web 
application. The solutions architect determines that the application needs to decrease latency 
when retrieving product details from the 
Amazon DynamoDB table. 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead? 
 
A. Set up a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster.  
Route all read requests through DAX. 
B. Set up Amazon ElastiCache for Redis between the DynamoDB table and the web application.  
Route all read requests through Redis. 
C. Set up Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached between the DynamoDB table and the web 
application.  
Route all read requests through Memcached. 
D. Set up Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table, and have AWS Lambda read from the table 
and populate Amazon ElastiCache. Route all read requests through ElastiCache. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Amazon DynamoDB is designed for scale and performance. In most cases, the DynamoDB 
response times can be measured in single-digit milliseconds. However, there are certain use 
cases that require response times in microseconds. For these use cases, DynamoDB Accelerator 
(DAX) delivers fast response times for accessing eventually consistent data. 
DAX is a DynamoDB-compatible caching service that enables you to benefit from fast in-memory 
performance for demanding applications.

D. Enable the security option to encrypt the S3 buckets through the use of a default AWS Key 
Management Service (AWS KMS) key. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Data protection refers to protecting data while in-transit (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) and 
at rest (while it is stored on disks in Amazon S3 data centers). You can protect data in transit 
using Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) or client-side encryption.

QUESTION 303 
A company's facility has badge readers at every entrance throughout the building. When badges 
are scanned, the readers send a message over HTTPS to indicate who attempted to access that 
particular entrance. 
 
A solutions architect must design a system to process these messages from the sensors. The 
solution must be highly available, and the results must be made available for the company's 
security team to analyze. 
 
Which system architecture should the solutions architect recommend?

154 
Explanation: 
This approach will allow the EC2 instance to access the internet and download the monthly 
security updates while still being located in a private subnet. By creating a NAT gateway and 
placing it in a public subnet, it will allow the instances in the private subnet to access the internet 
through the NAT gateway. And then, configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT 
gateway as the default route. This will ensure that all outbound traffic is directed through the NAT 
gateway, allowing the EC2 instance to access the internet while still maintaining the security of 
the private subnet.

QUESTION 306 
A company is running an application on Amazon EC2 instances. Traffic to the workload increases 
substantially during business hours and decreases afterward. The CPU utilization of an EC2 
instance is a strong indicator of end-user demand on the application. The company has 
configured an Auto Scaling group to have a minimum group size of 2 EC2 instances and a 
maximum group size of 10 EC2 instances. 
 
The company is concerned that the current scaling policy that is associated with the Auto Scaling 
group might not be correct. The company must avoid over-provisioning EC2 instances and 
incurring unnecessary costs. 
 
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to use a scheduled scaling plan and launch an additional 8 
EC2 instances during business hours. 
B. Configure AWS Auto Scaling to use a scaling plan that enables predictive scaling.  
Configure predictive scaling with a scaling mode of forecast and scale, and to enforce the 
maximum capacity setting during scaling. 
C. Configure a step scaling policy to add 4 EC2 instances at 50% CPU utilization and add another 4 
EC2 instances at 90% CPU utilization.

values. 
D. Configure AWS Auto Scaling to have a desired capacity of 5 EC2 instances, and disable any 
existing scaling policies.  
Monitor the CPU utilization metric for 1 week.  
Then create dynamic scaling policies that are based on the observed values. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Predictive Scaling, now natively supported as an EC2 Auto Scaling policy, uses machine learning 
to schedule the right number of EC2 instances in anticipation of approaching traffic changes. 
Predictive Scaling predicts future traffic, including regularly-occurring spikes, and provisions the 
right number of EC2 instances in advance. Predictive Scaling's machine learning algorithms 
detect changes in daily and weekly patterns, automatically adjusting their forecasts. This removes 
the need for manual adjustment of Auto Scaling parameters as cyclicality changes over time, 
making Auto Scaling simpler to configure. Auto Scaling enhanced with Predictive Scaling delivers 
faster, simpler, and more accurate capacity provisioning resulting in lower cost and more 
responsive applications. 
 
 
QUESTION 307

information, SMS messaging may be the right solution for you. 
You can use Amazon Pinpoint to create targeted groups of customers, and then send them 
campaign-based messages. You can also use Amazon Pinpoint to send direct messages, such 
as appointment confirmations, order updates, and one-time passwords. 
 
 
QUESTION 311 
The customers of a finance company request appointments with financial advisors by sending 
text messages. A web application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances accepts the appointment 
requests. The text messages are published to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) 
queue through the web application. Another application that runs on EC2 instances then sends 
meeting invitations and meeting confirmation email messages to the customers. After successful 
scheduling, this application stores the meeting information in an Amazon DynamoDB database. 
As the company expands, customers report that their meeting invitations are taking longer to 
arrive. 
What should a solutions architect recommend to resolve this issue? 
 
A. Add a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster in front of the DynamoDB database. 
B. Add an Amazon API Gateway API in front of the web application that accepts the appointment 
requests. 
C. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Set the origin as the web application that accepts the 
appointment requests. 
D. Add an Auto Scaling group for the application that sends meeting invitations. Configure the Auto 
Scaling group to scale based on the depth of the SQS queue. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
To resolve the issue of longer delivery times for meeting invitations, the solutions architect can 
recommend adding an Auto Scaling group for the application that sends meeting invitations and 
configuring the Auto Scaling group to scale based on the depth of the SQS queue. This will allow 
the application to scale up as the number of appointment requests increases, improving the 
performance and delivery times of the meeting invitations. 
 
 
QUESTION 312 
A company offers a food delivery service that is growing rapidly. Because of the growth, the

Data must not be lost because of a scaling event. 
A solutions architect must ensure that the order collection process and the order fulfillment 
process can both scale properly during peak traffic hours. The solution must optimize utilization of 
the company’s AWS resources. 
Which solution meets these requirements? 
 
A. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor the CPU of each instance in the Auto Scaling 
groups. Configure each Auto Scaling group’s minimum capacity according to peak workload 
values. 
B. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor the CPU of each instance in the Auto Scaling 
groups. Configure a CloudWatch alarm to invoke an Amazon Simple Notification Service 
(Amazon SNS) topic that creates additional Auto Scaling groups on demand. 
C. Provision two Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues: one for order collection 
and another for order fulfillment. Configure the EC2 instances to poll their respective queue. 
Scale the Auto Scaling groups based on notifications that the queues send. 
D. Provision two Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues: one for order collection 
and another for order fulfillment. Configure the EC2 instances to poll their respective queue. 
Create a metric based on a backlog per instance calculation. Scale the Auto Scaling groups 
based on this metric. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
The number of instances in your Auto Scaling group can be driven by how long it takes to 
process a message and the acceptable amount of latency (queue delay). The solution is to use a 
backlog per instance metric with the target value being the acceptable backlog per instance to 
maintain.

QUESTION 315 
A company is developing a new mobile app. The company must implement proper traffic filtering 
to protect its Application Load Balancer (ALB) against common application-level attacks, such as 
cross-site scripting or SQL injection. The company has minimal infrastructure and operational 
staff. The company needs to reduce its share of the responsibility in managing, updating, and 
securing servers for its AWS environment. 
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Configure AWS WAF rules and associate them with the ALB. 
B. Deploy the application using Amazon S3 with public hosting enabled. 
C. Deploy AWS Shield Advanced and add the ALB as a protected resource. 
D. Create a new ALB that directs traffic to an Amazon EC2 instance running a third-party firewall, 
which then passes the traffic to the current ALB. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
A solutions architect should recommend option A, which is to configure AWS WAF rules and 
associate them with the ALB. This will allow the company to apply traffic filtering at the application 
layer, which is necessary for protecting the ALB against common application-level attacks such 
as cross-site scripting or SQL injection. AWS WAF is a managed service that makes it easy to 
protect web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, 
compromise security, or consume excessive resources. The company can easily manage and 
update the rules to ensure the security of its application.

QUESTION 326 
A company has an API that receives real-time data from a fleet of monitoring devices. The API 
stores this data in an Amazon RDS DB instance for later analysis. The amount of data that the 
monitoring devices send to the API fluctuates. During periods of heavy traffic, the API often 
returns timeout errors. 
After an inspection of the logs, the company determines that the database is not capable of 
processing the volume of write traffic that comes from the API. A solutions architect must 
minimize the number of connections to the database and must ensure that data is not lost during 
periods of heavy traffic. 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Increase the size of the DB instance to an instance type that has more available memory. 
B. Modify the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ DB instance. Configure the application to write to all 
active RDS DB instances. 
C. Modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) 
queue. Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SQS invokes to write data from the queue to 
the database. 
D. Modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) 
topic. Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SNS invokes to write data from the topic to the 
database. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Using Amazon SQS will help minimize the number of connections to the database, as the API will 
write data to a queue instead of directly to the database. Additionally, using an AWS Lambda 
function that Amazon SQS invokes to write data from the queue to the database will help ensure 
that data is not lost during periods of heavy traffic, as the queue will serve as a buffer between 
the API and the database.

QUESTION 328 
A company is concerned that two NAT instances in use will no longer be able to support the 
traffic needed for the company’s application. A solutions architect wants to implement a solution 
that is highly available, fault tolerant, and automatically scalable. 
What should the solutions architect recommend? 
 
A. Remove the two NAT instances and replace them with two NAT gateways in the same Availability 
Zone. 
B. Use Auto Scaling groups with Network Load Balancers for the NAT instances in different 
Availability Zones. 
C. Remove the two NAT instances and replace them with two NAT gateways in different Availability 
Zones. 
D. Replace the two NAT instances with Spot Instances in different Availability Zones and deploy a 
Network Load Balancer. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
If you have resources in multiple Availability Zones and they share one NAT gateway, and if the 
NAT gateway's Availability Zone is down, resources in the other Availability Zones lose internet 
access. To create an Availability Zone-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each 
Availability Zone and configure your routing to ensure that resources use the NAT gateway in the 
same Availability Zone.

QUESTION 339 
A company is using a content management system that runs on a single Amazon EC2 instance. 
The EC2 instance contains both the web server and the database software. The company must 
make its website platform highly available and must enable the website to scale to meet user 
demand. 
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Move the database to Amazon RDS, and enable automatic backups. Manually launch another 
EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone. Configure an Application Load Balancer in the 
Availability Zone, and set the two instances as targets. 
B. Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora instance with a read replica in the same Availability

Zone as the existing EC2 instance. Manually launch another EC2 instance in the same 
Availability Zone. Configure an Application Load Balancer, and set the two EC2 instances as 
targets. 
C. Move the database to Amazon Aurora with a read replica in another Availability Zone. Create an 
Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the EC2 instance. Configure an Application Load Balancer in 
two Availability Zones. Attach an Auto Scaling group that uses the AMI across two Availability 
Zones. 
D. Move the database to a separate EC2 instance, and schedule backups to Amazon S3. Create an 
Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the original EC2 instance. Configure an Application Load 
Balancer in two Availability Zones. Attach an Auto Scaling group that uses the AMI across two 
Availability Zones. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
This approach will provide both high availability and scalability for the website platform. By 
moving the database to Amazon Aurora with a read replica in another availability zone, it will 
provide a failover option for the database. The use of an Application Load Balancer and an Auto 
Scaling group across two availability zones allows for automatic scaling of the website to meet 
increased user demand. Additionally, creating an AMI from the original EC2 instance allows for 
easy replication of the instance in case of failure. 
 
 
QUESTION 340 
A company is launching an application on AWS. The application uses an Application Load 
Balancer (ALB) to direct traffic to at least two Amazon EC2 instances in a single target group. The 
instances are in an Auto Scaling group for each environment. The company requires a 
development environment and a production environment. The production environment will have 
periods of high traffic. 
Which solution will configure the development environment MOST cost-effectively? 
 
A. Reconfigure the target group in the development environment to have only one EC2 instance as a 
target. 
B. Change the ALB balancing algorithm to least outstanding requests. 
C. Reduce the size of the EC2 instances in both environments. 
D. Reduce the maximum number of EC2 instances in the development environment’s Auto Scaling 
group. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
This option will configure the development environment in the most cost-effective way as it 
reduces the number of instances running in the development environment and therefore reduces 
the cost of running the application. The development environment typically requires less 
resources than the production environment, and it is unlikely that the development environment 
will have periods of high traffic that would require a large number of instances. By reducing the 
maximum number of instances in the development environment's Auto Scaling group, the 
company can save on costs while still maintaining a functional development environment. 
 
 
QUESTION 341 
A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones. The 
EC2 instances are in private subnets. A solutions architect implements an internet-facing 
Application Load Balancer (ALB) and specifies the EC2 instances as the target group. However, 
the internet traffic is not reaching the EC2 instances. 
How should the solutions architect reconfigure the architecture to resolve this issue?

QUESTION 342 
A company has deployed a database in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Due to increased transactions, 
the database support team is reporting slow reads against the DB instance and recommends 
adding a read replica. 
Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take before implementing this change? 
(Choose two.) 
 
A. Enable binlog replication on the RDS primary node. 
B. Choose a failover priority for the source DB instance. 
C. Allow long-running transactions to complete on the source DB instance. 
D. Create a global table and specify the AWS Regions where the table will be available. 
E. Enable automatic backups on the source instance by setting the backup retention period to a 
value other than 0. 
 
Answer: CE 
Explanation: 
An active, long-running transaction can slow the process of creating the read replica. We 
recommend that you wait for long-running transactions to complete before creating a read replica. 
If you create multiple read replicas in parallel from the same source DB instance, Amazon RDS 
takes only one snapshot at the start of the first create action. 
When creating a read replica, there are a few things to consider. First, you must enable automatic 
backups on the source DB instance by setting the backup retention period to a value other than 0. 
This requirement also applies to a read replica that is the source DB instance for another read 
replica.

QUESTION 343 
A company runs analytics software on Amazon EC2 instances. The software accepts job 
requests from users to process data that has been uploaded to Amazon S3. Users report that 
some submitted data is not being processed Amazon CloudWatch reveals that the EC2 instances 
have a consistent CPU utilization at or near 100%. The company wants to improve system 
performance and scale the system based on user load. 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Create a copy of the instance. Place all instances behind an Application Load Balancer. 
B. Create an S3 VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. Update the software to reference the endpoint. 
C. Stop the EC2 instances. Modify the instance type to one with a more powerful CPU and more 
memory. Restart the instances.

D. Route incoming requests to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Configure an EC2 
Auto Scaling group based on queue size. Update the software to read from the queue. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
By routing incoming requests to Amazon SQS, the company can decouple the job requests from 
the processing instances. This allows them to scale the number of instances based on the size of 
the queue, providing more resources when needed. Additionally, using an Auto Scaling group 
based on the queue size will automatically scale the number of instances up or down depending 
on the workload. Updating the software to read from the queue will allow it to process the job 
requests in a more efficient manner, improving the performance of the system.

QUESTION 348 
A company is reviewing a recent migration of a three-tier application to a VPC. The security team 
discovers that the principle of least privilege is not being applied to Amazon EC2 security group 
ingress and egress rules between the application tiers. 
What should a solutions architect do to correct this issue? 
 
A. Create security group rules using the instance ID as the source or destination. 
B. Create security group rules using the security group ID as the source or destination. 
C. Create security group rules using the VPC CIDR blocks as the source or destination. 
D. Create security group rules using the subnet CIDR blocks as the source or destination. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
The ID of a security group (referred to here as the specified security group). For example, the 
current security group, a security group from the same VPC, or a security group for a peered 
VPC. This allows traffic based on the private IP addresses of the resources associated with the 
specified security group. This does not add rules from the specified security group to the current 
security group.

applications in an AWS account. The company needs to use a serverless solution to store the 
EC2 Auto Scaling status data in Amazon S3. The company then will use the data in Amazon S3 
to provide near-real-time updates in a dashboard. The solution must not affect the speed of EC2 
instance launches. 
How should the company move the data to Amazon S3 to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Use an Amazon CloudWatch metric stream to send the EC2 Auto Scaling status data to Amazon 
Kinesis Data Firehose. Store the data in Amazon S3. 
B. Launch an Amazon EMR cluster to collect the EC2 Auto Scaling status data and send the data to 
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. Store the data in Amazon S3. 
C. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function on a schedule. 
Configure the Lambda function to send the EC2 Auto Scaling status data directly to Amazon S3.

Configure Kinesis Agent to collect the EC2 Auto Scaling status data and send the data to Amazon 
Kinesis Data Firehose. Store the data in Amazon S3. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
You can use metric streams to continually stream CloudWatch metrics to a destination of your 
choice, with near-real-time delivery and low latency. One of the use cases is Data Lake: create a 
metric stream and direct it to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that delivers your 
CloudWatch metrics to a data lake such as Amazon S3.

QUESTION 353 
A company’s compliance team needs to move its file shares to AWS. The shares run on a 
Windows Server SMB file share. A self-managed on-premises Active Directory controls access to 
the files and folders. 
The company wants to use Amazon FSx for Windows File Server as part of the solution. The 
company must ensure that the on-premises Active Directory groups restrict access to the FSx for 
Windows File Server SMB compliance shares, folders, and files after the move to AWS. The 
company has created an FSx for Windows File Server file system. 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Create an Active Directory Connector to connect to the Active Directory. Map the Active Directory 
groups to IAM groups to restrict access. 
B. Assign a tag with a Restrict tag key and a Compliance tag value. Map the Active Directory groups 
to IAM groups to restrict access. 
C. Create an IAM service-linked role that is linked directly to FSx for Windows File Server to restrict 
access. 
D. Join the file system to the Active Directory to restrict access. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Joining the FSx for Windows File Server file system to the on-premises Active Directory will allow 
the company to use the existing Active Directory groups to restrict access to the file shares, 
folders, and files after the move to AWS. This option allows the company to continue using their 
existing access controls and management structure, making the transition to AWS more 
seamless.

QUESTION 355 
A company plans to use Amazon ElastiCache for its multi-tier web application. A solutions 
architect creates a Cache VPC for the ElastiCache cluster and an App VPC for the application’s 
Amazon EC2 instances. Both VPCs are in the us-east-1 Region. 
The solutions architect must implement a solution to provide the application’s EC2 instances with 
access to the ElastiCache cluster. 
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 
 
A. Create a peering connection between the VPCs. Add a route table entry for the peering 
connection in both VPCs. Configure an inbound rule for the ElastiCache cluster’s security group 
to allow inbound connection from the application’s security group. 
B. Create a Transit VPC. Update the VPC route tables in the Cache VPC and the App VPC to route 
traffic through the Transit VPC. Configure an inbound rule for the ElastiCache cluster's security 
group to allow inbound connection from the application’s security group. 
C. Create a peering connection between the VPCs. Add a route table entry for the peering 
connection in both VPCs. Configure an inbound rule for the peering connection’s security group to 
allow inbound connection from the application’s security group. 
D. Create a Transit VPC. Update the VPC route tables in the Cache VPC and the App VPC to route 
traffic through the Transit VPC. Configure an inbound rule for the Transit VPC’s security group to 
allow inbound connection from the application’s security group. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Creating a peering connection between the VPCs allows the application's EC2 instances to 
communicate with the ElastiCache cluster directly and efficiently. This is the most cost-effective 
solution as it does not involve creating additional resources such as a Transit VPC, and it does 
not incur additional costs for traffic passing through the Transit VPC. Additionally, it is also more 
secure as it allows you to configure a more restrictive security group rule to allow inbound 
connection from only the application's security group.

QUESTION 357 
A company has a web application hosted over 10 Amazon EC2 instances with traffic directed by 
Amazon Route 53. The company occasionally experiences a timeout error when attempting to 
browse the application. The networking team finds that some DNS queries return IP addresses of 
unhealthy instances, resulting in the timeout error. 
What should a solutions architect implement to overcome these timeout errors? 
 
A. Create a Route 53 simple routing policy record for each EC2 instance. Associate a health check 
with each record. 
B. Create a Route 53 failover routing policy record for each EC2 instance. Associate a health check 
with each record. 
C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with EC2 instances as its origin. Associate a health 
check with the EC2 instances. 
D. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with a health check in front of the EC2 instances. 
Route to the ALB from Route 53. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
An Application Load Balancer (ALB) allows you to distribute incoming traffic across multiple 
backend instances, and can automatically route traffic to healthy instances while removing traffic 
from unhealthy instances. By using an ALB in front of the EC2 instances and routing traffic to it 
from Route 53, the load balancer can perform health checks on the instances and only route 
traffic to healthy instances, which should help to reduce or eliminate timeout errors caused by 
unhealthy instances. 
 
 
QUESTION 358 
A solutions architect needs to design a highly available application consisting of web, application, 
and database tiers. HTTPS content delivery should be as close to the edge as possible, with the 
least delivery time. 
Which solution meets these requirements and is MOST secure? 
 
A. Configure a public Application Load Balancer (ALB) with multiple redundant Amazon EC2 
instances in public subnets. Configure Amazon CloudFront to deliver HTTPS content using the

instances as the origin. 
C. Configure a public Application Load Balancer (ALB) with multiple redundant Amazon EC2 
instances in private subnets. Configure Amazon CloudFront to deliver HTTPS content using the 
public ALB as the origin. 
D. Configure a public Application Load Balancer with multiple redundant Amazon EC2 instances in 
public subnets. Configure Amazon CloudFront to deliver HTTPS content using the EC2 instances 
as the origin. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
This solution meets the requirements for a highly available application with web, application, and 
database tiers, as well as providing edge-based content delivery. Additionally, it maximizes 
security by having the ALB in a private subnet, which limits direct access to the web servers, 
while still being able to serve traffic over the Internet via the public ALB. This will ensure that the 
web servers are not exposed to the public Internet, which reduces the attack surface and 
provides a secure way to access the application.

QUESTION 359 
A company has a popular gaming platform running on AWS. The application is sensitive to 
latency because latency can impact the user experience and introduce unfair advantages to 
some players. The application is deployed in every AWS Region. It runs on Amazon EC2 
instances that are part of Auto Scaling groups configured behind Application Load Balancers 
(ALBs). A solutions architect needs to implement a mechanism to monitor the health of the 
application and redirect traffic to healthy endpoints. 
Which solution meets these requirements? 
 
A. Configure an accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Add a listener for the port that the 
application listens on, and attach it to a Regional endpoint in each Region. Add the ALB as the 
endpoint. 
B. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution and specify the ALB as the origin server. Configure the 
cache behavior to use origin cache headers. Use AWS Lambda functions to optimize the traffic. 
C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution and specify Amazon S3 as the origin server. Configure 
the cache behavior to use origin cache headers. Use AWS Lambda functions to optimize the 
traffic. 
D. Configure an Amazon DynamoDB database to serve as the data store for the application. Create 
a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster to act as the in-memory cache for DynamoDB hosting the 
application data. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
When you have an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer that includes multiple 
target groups, Global Accelerator considers the load balancer endpoint to be healthy only if each 
target group behind the load balancer has at least one healthy target. If any single target group 
for the load balancer has only unhealthy targets, Global Accelerator considers the endpoint to be 
unhealthy.

QUESTION 361 
An ecommerce company has noticed performance degradation of its Amazon RDS based web 
application. The performance degradation is attributed to an increase in the number of read-only 
SQL queries triggered by business analysts. A solutions architect needs to solve the problem with 
minimal changes to the existing web application. 
What should the solutions architect recommend? 
 
A. Export the data to Amazon DynamoDB and have the business analysts run their queries. 
B. Load the data into Amazon ElastiCache and have the business analysts run their queries. 
C. Create a read replica of the primary database and have the business analysts run their queries. 
D. Copy the data into an Amazon Redshift cluster and have the business analysts run their queries. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Creating a read replica of the primary RDS database will offload the read-only SQL queries from 
the primary database, which will help to improve the performance of the web application. Read 
replicas are exact copies of the primary database that can be used to handle read-only traffic, 
which will reduce the load on the primary database and improve the performance of the web 
application. This solution can be implemented with minimal changes to the existing web 
application, as the business analysts can continue to run their queries on the read replica without 
modifying the code.

QUESTION 363 
A company has a multi-tier application deployed on several Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto 
Scaling group. An Amazon RDS for Oracle instance is the application' s data layer that uses 
Oracle-specific PL/SQL functions. Traffic to the application has been steadily increasing. This is 
causing the EC2 instances to become overloaded and the RDS instance to run out of storage. 
The Auto Scaling group does not have any scaling metrics and defines the minimum healthy 
instance count only. The company predicts that traffic will continue to increase at a steady but 
unpredictable rate before leveling off. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to ensure the system can automatically scale for the 
increased traffic? (Choose two.) 
 
A. Configure storage Auto Scaling on the RDS for Oracle instance. 
B. Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora to use Auto Scaling storage.

QUESTION 364 
A company provides an online service for posting video content and transcoding it for use by any 
mobile platform. The application architecture uses Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) 
Standard to collect and store the videos so that multiple Amazon EC2 Linux instances can access 
the video content for processing. As the popularity of the service has grown over time, the 
storage costs have become too expensive. 
 
Which storage solution is MOST cost-effective? 
 
A. Use AWS Storage Gateway for files to store and process the video content. 
B. Use AWS Storage Gateway for volumes to store and process the video content. 
C. Use Amazon EFS for storing the video content. Once processing is complete, transfer the files to 
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). 
D. Use Amazon S3 for storing the video content. Move the files temporarily over to an Amazon 
Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume attached to the server for processing. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
A better solution would be to use a transcoding service like Amazon Elastic Transcoder to 
process the video content directly from Amazon S3. This would eliminate the need for storing the

QUESTION 370 
A research company runs experiments that are powered by a simulation application and a 
visualization application. The simulation application runs on Linux and outputs intermediate data 
to an NFS share every 5 minutes. The visualization application is a Windows desktop application 
that displays the simulation output and requires an SMB file system. 
 
The company maintains two synchronized file systems. This strategy is causing data duplication 
and inefficient resource usage. The company needs to migrate the applications to AWS without 
making code changes to either application. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Migrate both applications to AWS Lambda. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to exchange data 
between the applications. 
B. Migrate both applications to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Configure 
Amazon FSx File Gateway for storage. 
C. Migrate the simulation application to Linux Amazon EC2 instances. Migrate the visualization 
application to Windows EC2 instances. Configure Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) 
to exchange data between the applications. 
D. Migrate the simulation application to Linux Amazon EC2 instances. Migrate the visualization 
application to Windows EC2 instances. Configure Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP for storage. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP is a fully-managed shared storage service built on NetApp's 
popular ONTAP file system. Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP provides the popular features, 
performance, and APIs of ONTAP file systems with the agility, scalability, and simplicity of a fully 
managed AWS service, making it easier for customers to migrate on-premises applications that 
rely on NAS appliances to AWS. FSx for ONTAP file systems are similar to on-premises NetApp 
clusters. Within each file system that you create, you also create one or more storage virtual 
machines (SVMs). These are isolated file servers each with their own endpoints for NFS, SMB, 
and management access, as well as authentication (for both administration and end-user data 
access). In turn, each SVM has one or more volumes which store your data.

QUESTION 375 
A company is migrating a Linux-based web server group to AWS. The web servers must access 
files in a shared file store for some content. The company must not make any changes to the 
application. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Create an Amazon S3 Standard bucket with access to the web servers. 
B. Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an Amazon S3 bucket as the origin. 
C. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system on 
all web servers. 
D. Configure a General Purpose SSD (gp3) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. 
Mount the EBS volume to all web servers. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. 
Mount the EFS file system on all web servers. 
To meet the requirements of providing a shared file store for Linux-based web servers without 
making changes to the application, using an Amazon EFS file system is the best solution. 
Amazon EFS is a managed NFS file system service that provides shared access to files across 
multiple Linux-based instances, which makes it suitable for this use case. 
Amazon S3 is not ideal for this scenario since it is an object storage service and not a file system, 
and it requires additional tools or libraries to mount the S3 bucket as a file system. 
Amazon CloudFront can be used to improve content delivery performance but is not necessary 
for this requirement.

Additionally, Amazon EBS volumes can only be mounted to one instance at a time, so it is not 
suitable for sharing files across multiple instances. 
 
 
QUESTION 376 
A company has an AWS Lambda function that needs read access to an Amazon S3 bucket that 
is located in the same AWS account. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST secure manner? 
 
A. Apply an S3 bucket policy that grants read access to the S3 bucket. 
B. Apply an IAM role to the Lambda function. Apply an IAM policy to the role to grant read access to 
the S3 bucket. 
C. Embed an access key and a secret key in the Lambda function's code to grant the required IAM 
permissions for read access to the S3 bucket. 
D. Apply an IAM role to the Lambda function. Apply an IAM policy to the role to grant read access to 
all S3 buckets in the account. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
This is the most secure and recommended way to provide an AWS Lambda function with access 
to an S3 bucket. It involves creating an IAM role that the Lambda function assumes, and 
attaching an IAM policy to the role that grants the necessary permissions to read from the S3 
bucket.

A. Signed cookies 
B. Signed URLs 
C. AWS AppSync 
D. JSON Web Token (JWT) 
E. AWS Secrets Manager 
 
Answer: AB 
Explanation: 
Signed URLs are URLs that grant temporary access to an S3 object. They include a signature 
that verifies the authenticity of the request, as well as an expiration date that limits the time during 
which the URL is valid. This solution will work for users who are using custom HTTP clients that 
do not support cookies. 
Signed cookies are similar to signed URLs, but they use cookies to grant temporary access to S3 
objects. This solution will work for users who are unable to change the hardcoded URLs that they 
are using for access.

QUESTION 382 
An ecommerce company stores terabytes of customer data in the AWS Cloud. The data contains 
personally identifiable information (PII). The company wants to use the data in three applications. 
Only one of the applications needs to process the PII. The PII must be removed before the other 
two applications process the data. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 
 
A. Store the data in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Create a proxy application layer to intercept and 
process the data that each application requests. 
B. Store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. Process and transform the data by using S3 Object 
Lambda before returning the data to the requesting application. 
C. Process the data and store the transformed data in three separate Amazon S3 buckets so that 
each application has its own custom dataset. Point each application to its respective S3 bucket. 
D. Process the data and store the transformed data in three separate Amazon DynamoDB tables so 
that each application has its own custom dataset. Point each application to its respective 
DynamoDB table. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Amazon S3 Object Lambda allows you to add custom code to S3 GET requests, which means 
that you can modify the data before it is returned to the requesting application. In this case, you

QUESTION 384 
A company deploys an application on five Amazon EC2 instances. An Application Load Balancer 
(ALB) distributes traffic to the instances by using a target group. The average CPU usage on 
each of the instances is below 10% most of the time, with occasional surges to 65%. 
 
A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to automate the scalability of the application. 
The solution must optimize the cost of the architecture and must ensure that the application has 
enough CPU resources when surges occur. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that enters the ALARM state when the CPUUtilization 
metric is less than 20%. Create an AWS Lambda function that the CloudWatch alarm invokes to 
terminate one of the EC2 instances in the ALB target group. 
B. Create an EC2 Auto Scaling group. Select the existing ALB as the load balancer and the existing 
target group as the target group. Set a target tracking scaling policy that is based on the 
ASGAverageCPUUtilization metric. Set the minimum instances to 2, the desired capacity to 3, the 
maximum instances to 6, and the target value to 50%. Add the EC2 instances to the Auto Scaling 
group. 
C. Create an EC2 Auto Scaling group. Select the existing ALB as the load balancer and the existing 
target group as the target group. Set the minimum instances to 2, the desired capacity to 3, and 
the maximum instances to 6. Add the EC2 instances to the Auto Scaling group. 
D. Create two Amazon CloudWatch alarms. Configure the first CloudWatch alarm to enter the 
ALARM state when the average CPUUtilization metric is below 20%. Configure the second

topic to send an email message. After receiving the message, log in to decrease or increase the 
number of EC2 instances that are running. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
It allows for automatic scaling based on the average CPU utilization of the EC2 instances in the 
target group. With the use of a target tracking scaling policy based on the 
ASGAverageCPUUtilization metric, the EC2 Auto Scaling group can ensure that the target value 
of 50% is maintained while scaling the number of instances in the group up or down as needed. 
This will help ensure that the application has enough CPU resources during surges without 
overprovisioning, thus optimizing the cost of the architecture.

QUESTION 394 
A company that primarily runs its application servers on premises has decided to migrate to AWS. 
The company wants to minimize its need to scale its Internet Small Computer Systems Interface 
(iSCSI) storage on premises. The company wants only its recently accessed data to remain 
stored locally. 
 
Which AWS solution should the company use to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Amazon S3 File Gateway 
B. AWS Storage Gateway Tape Gateway 
C. AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway stored volumes 
D. AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway cached volumes 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway provides two configurations for connecting to iSCSI 
storage, namely, stored volumes and cached volumes. The stored volume configuration stores 
the entire data set on-premises and asynchronously backs up the data to AWS. The cached 
volume configuration stores recently accessed data on-premises, and the remaining data is 
stored in Amazon S3. 
Since the company wants only its recently accessed data to remain stored locally, the cached 
volume configuration would be the most appropriate. It allows the company to keep frequently 
accessed data on-premises and reduce the need for scaling its iSCSI storage while still providing 
access to all data through the AWS cloud. This configuration also provides low-latency access to 
frequently accessed data and cost-effective off-site backups for less frequently accessed data.

To reduce the cost associated with data transfers and maintain or improve performance, a 
solutions architect should use Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) service that 
securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and 
high transfer speeds. 
Deploying a CloudFront distribution with the existing S3 bucket as the origin will allow the 
company to serve the data to customers from edge locations that are closer to them, reducing 
data transfer costs and improving performance. 
Directing customer requests to the CloudFront URL and switching to CloudFront signed URLs for 
access control will enable customers to access the data securely and efficiently.

QUESTION 398 
A company is using AWS to design a web application that will process insurance quotes. Users 
will request quotes from the application. Quotes must be separated by quote type, must be 
responded to within 24 hours, and must not get lost. The solution must maximize operational 
efficiency and must minimize maintenance. 
 
Which solution meets these requirements? 
 
A. Create multiple Amazon Kinesis data streams based on the quote type. Configure the web 
application to send messages to the proper data stream. Configure each backend group of 
application servers to use the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) to pool messages from its own data 
stream. 
B. Create an AWS Lambda function and an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) 
topic for each quote type. Subscribe the Lambda function to its associated SNS topic. Configure 
the application to publish requests for quotes to the appropriate SNS topic. 
C. Create a single Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe Amazon 
Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues to the SNS topic. Configure SNS message filtering 
to publish messages to the proper SQS queue based on the quote type. Configure each backend 
application server to use its own SQS queue. 
D. Create multiple Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams based on the quote type to 
deliver data streams to an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster. Configure the application to 
send messages to the proper delivery stream. Configure each backend group of application 
servers to search for the messages from OpenSearch Service and process them accordingly. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Quote types need to be separated: SNS message filtering can be used to publish messages to 
the appropriate SQS queue based on the quote type, ensuring that quotes are separated by type. 
Quotes must be responded to within 24 hours and must not get lost: SQS provides reliable and 
scalable queuing for messages, ensuring that quotes will not get lost and can be processed in a

timely manner. Additionally, each backend application server can use its own SQS queue, 
ensuring that quotes are processed efficiently without any delay. 
Operational efficiency and minimizing maintenance: Using a single SNS topic and multiple SQS 
queues is a scalable and cost-effective approach, which can help to maximize operational 
efficiency and minimize maintenance. Additionally, SNS and SQS are fully managed services, 
which means that the company will not need to worry about maintenance tasks such as software 
updates, hardware upgrades, or scaling the infrastructure.

QUESTION 415 
A company is hosting a three-tier ecommerce application in the AWS Cloud. The company hosts 
the website on Amazon S3 and integrates the website with an API that handles sales requests. 
The company hosts the API on three Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load 
Balancer (ALB). The API consists of static and dynamic front-end content along with backend 
workers that process sales requests asynchronously. 
 
The company is expecting a significant and sudden increase in the number of sales requests 
during events for the launch of new products. 
 
What should a solutions architect recommend to ensure that all the requests are processed 
successfully? 
 
A. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the dynamic content. Increase the number of EC2 
instances to handle the increase in traffic. 
B. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the static content. Place the EC2 instances in an Auto 
Scaling group to launch new instances based on network traffic. 
C. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the dynamic content. Add an Amazon ElastiCache 
instance in front of the ALB to reduce traffic for the API to handle. 
D. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the static content. Add an Amazon Simple Queue 
Service (Amazon SQS) queue to receive requests from the website for later processing by the 
EC2 instances. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Static content can include images and style sheets that are the same across all users and are 
best cached at the edges of the content distribution network (CDN). Dynamic content includes 
information that changes frequently or is personalized based on user preferences, behavior, 
location or other factors - all content is sales requests.

QUESTION 417 
A company is planning to store data on Amazon RDS DB instances. The company must encrypt 
the data at rest. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement? 
 
A. Create a key in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Enable encryption for the DB 
instances. 
B. Create an encryption key. Store the key in AWS Secrets Manager. Use the key to encrypt the DB 
instances. 
C. Generate a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Enable SSL/TLS on the DB instances 
by using the certificate. 
D. Generate a certificate in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Enable SSL/TLS on the 
DB instances by using the certificate. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
To encrypt data at rest in Amazon RDS, you can use the encryption feature of Amazon RDS, 
which uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). With this feature, Amazon RDS 
encrypts each database instance with a unique key. This key is stored securely by AWS KMS. 
You can manage your own keys or use the default AWS-managed keys. When you enable 
encryption for a DB instance, Amazon RDS encrypts the underlying storage, including the 
automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots.

QUESTION 420 
A company's application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer 
(ALB). The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability 
Zones. On the first day of every month at midnight, the application becomes much slower when 
the month-end financial calculation batch runs. This causes the CPU utilization of the EC2 
instances to immediately peak to 100%, which disrupts the application. 
 
What should a solutions architect recommend to ensure the application is able to handle the 
workload and avoid downtime? 
 
A. Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the ALB. 
B. Configure an EC2 Auto Scaling simple scaling policy based on CPU utilization.

QUESTION 422 
A company is experiencing sudden increases in demand. The company needs to provision large 
Amazon EC2 instances from an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). The instances will run in an Auto 
Scaling group. The company needs a solution that provides minimum initialization latency to meet 
the demand. 
 
Which solution meets these requirements? 
 
A. Use the aws ec2 register-image command to create an AMI from a snapshot. Use AWS Step 
Functions to replace the AMI in the Auto Scaling group. 
B. Enable Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) fast snapshot restore on a snapshot. 
Provision an AMI by using the snapshot. Replace the AMI in the Auto Scaling group with the new 
AMI. 
C. Enable AMI creation and define lifecycle rules in Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon 
DLM). Create an AWS Lambda function that modifies the AMI in the Auto Scaling group. 
D. Use Amazon EventBridge to invoke AWS Backup lifecycle policies that provision AMIs. Configure 
Auto Scaling group capacity limits as an event source in EventBridge. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Enabling Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) fast snapshot restore on a snapshot allows 
you to quickly create a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from a snapshot, which can help 
reduce the initialization latency when provisioning new instances. Once the AMI is provisioned, 
you can replace the AMI in the Auto Scaling group with the new AMI. This will ensure that new 
instances are launched from the updated AMI and are able to meet the increased demand 
quickly.

QUESTION 423 
A company hosts a multi-tier web application that uses an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster for 
storage. The application tier is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances. The company's IT security 
guidelines mandate that the database credentials be encrypted and rotated every 14 days. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement with the LEAST operational effort? 
 
A. Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key. Use AWS Secrets 
Manager to create a new secret that uses the KMS key with the appropriate credentials. 
Associate the secret with the Aurora DB cluster. Configure a custom rotation period of 14 days. 
B. Create two parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store: one for the user name as a 
string parameter and one that uses the SecureString type for the password. Select AWS Key 
Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption for the password parameter, and load these 
parameters in the application tier. Implement an AWS Lambda function that rotates the password 
every 14 days. 
C. Store a file that contains the credentials in an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) 
encrypted Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system in 
all EC2 instances of the application tier. Restrict the access to the file on the file system so that 
the application can read the file and that only super users can modify the file. Implement an AWS 
Lambda function that rotates the key in Aurora every 14 days and writes new credentials into the 
file. 
D. Store a file that contains the credentials in an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) 
encrypted Amazon S3 bucket that the application uses to load the credentials. Download the file 
to the application regularly to ensure that the correct credentials are used. Implement an AWS 
Lambda function that rotates the Aurora credentials every 14 days and uploads these credentials 
to the file in the S3 bucket. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
To implement password rotation lifecycles, use AWS Secrets Manager. You can rotate, manage, 
and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle using 
Secrets Manager.

QUESTION 424 
A company has deployed a web application on AWS. The company hosts the backend database 
on Amazon RDS for MySQL with a primary DB instance and five read replicas to support scaling 
needs. The read replicas must lag no more than 1 second behind the primary DB instance. The 
database routinely runs scheduled stored procedures. 
 
As traffic on the website increases, the replicas experience additional lag during periods of peak 
load. A solutions architect must reduce the replication lag as much as possible. The solutions 
architect must minimize changes to the application code and must minimize ongoing operational 
overhead. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora MySQL. Replace the read replicas with Aurora Replicas, 
and configure Aurora Auto Scaling. Replace the stored procedures with Aurora MySQL native 
functions. 
B. Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster in front of the database. Modify the application 
to check the cache before the application queries the database. Replace the stored procedures 
with AWS Lambda functions.

Amazon S3 as the data source in QuickSight. 
D. Use a Lake Formation blueprint to ingest the data from the database to the S3 data lake. Use 
Lake Formation to enforce column-level access control for the QuickSight users. Use Amazon 
Athena as the data source in QuickSight. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
This solution leverages AWS Lake Formation to ingest data from the Aurora MySQL database 
into the S3 data lake, while enforcing column-level access control for QuickSight users. Lake 
Formation can be used to create and manage the data lake's metadata and enforce security and 
governance policies, including column-level access control. This solution then uses Amazon 
Athena as the data source in QuickSight to query the data in the S3 data lake. This solution 
minimizes operational overhead by leveraging AWS services to manage and secure the data, and 
by using a standard query service (Amazon Athena) to provide a SQL interface to the data.

Transfer Acceleration to serve the web application globally. 
D. Use AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory for authentication. Use Lambda@Edge 
for authorization. Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to serve the web application globally. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service that can securely deliver 
web content, videos, and APIs at scale. It integrates with Cognito for authentication and with 
Lambda@Edge for authorization, making it an ideal choice for serving web content globally. 
Lambda@Edge is a service that lets you run AWS Lambda functions globally closer to users, 
providing lower latency and faster response times. It can also handle authorization logic at the 
edge to secure content in CloudFront. For this scenario, Lambda@Edge can provide 
authorization for the web application while leveraging the low-latency benefit of running at the 
edge. 
 
 
QUESTION 433 
A company has an aging network-attached storage (NAS) array in its data center. The NAS array 
presents SMB shares and NFS shares to client workstations. The company does not want to 
purchase a new NAS array. The company also does not want to incur the cost of renewing the 
NAS array's support contract. Some of the data is accessed frequently, but much of the data is 
inactive. 
 
A solutions architect needs to implement a solution that migrates the data to Amazon S3, uses S3 
Lifecycle policies, and maintains the same look and feel for the client workstations. The solutions 
architect has identified AWS Storage Gateway as part of the solution. 
 
Which type of storage gateway should the solutions architect provision to meet these 
requirements? 
 
A. Volume Gateway 
B. Tape Gateway 
C. Amazon FSx File Gateway 
D. Amazon S3 File Gateway 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Amazon S3 File Gateway provides a file interface to objects stored in S3. It can be used for a file-
based interface with S3, which allows the company to migrate their NAS array data to S3 while 
maintaining the same look and feel for client workstations. Amazon S3 File Gateway supports 
SMB and NFS protocols, which will allow clients to continue to access the data using these 
protocols. Additionally, Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies can be used to automate the movement of 
data to lower-cost storage tiers, reducing the storage cost of inactive data.

on all application resources and to keep network latency between the services low. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Purchase on an EC2 instance Savings Plan. Optimize the Lambda functions duration and 
memory usage and the number of invocations. Connect the Lambda functions to the private 
subnet that contains the EC2 instances. 
B. Purchase on an EC2 instance Savings Plan. Optimize the Lambda functions duration and 
memory usage and the number of invocation, and the amount of data that is transfered. Connect 
the Lambda functions to a public subnet in the same VPC where the EC2 instances run. 
C. Purchase a Compute Savings Plan. Optimize the Lambda functions duration and memory usage, 
the number of invocations, and the amount of data that is transferred. Connect the Lambda 
function to the Private subnet that contains the EC2 instances. 
D. Purchase a Compute Savings Plan. Optimize the Lambda functions' duration and memory usage, 
the number of invocations, and the amount of data that is transferred. Keep the Lambda functions 
in the Lambda service VPC. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
By purchasing a Compute Savings Plan, the company can save on the costs of running both EC2 
instances and Lambda functions. The Lambda functions can be connected to the private subnet 
that contains the EC2 instances through a VPC endpoint for AWS services or a VPC peering 
connection. This provides direct network access to the EC2 instances while keeping the traffic 
within the private network, which helps to minimize network latency. 
 
Optimizing the Lambda functions’ duration, memory usage, number of invocations, and amount of 
data transferred can help to further minimize costs and improve performance. Additionally, using 
a private subnet helps to ensure that the EC2 instances are not directly accessible from the public 
internet, which is a security best practice.

A company is hosting a three-tier ecommerce application in the AWS Cloud. The company hosts 
the website on Amazon S3 and integrates the website with an API that handles sales requests. 
The company hosts the API on three Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load 
Balancer (ALB). The API consists of static and dynamic front-end content along with backend 
workers that process sales requests asynchronously. 
 
The company is expecting a significant and sudden increase in the number of sales requests 
during events for the launch of new products. 
 
What should a solutions architect recommend to ensure that all the requests are processed 
successfully? 
 
A. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the dynamic content. Increase the number of EC2 
instances to handle the increase in traffic. 
B. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the static content. Place the EC2 instances in an Auto 
Scaling group to launch new instances based on network traffic. 
C. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the dynamic content. Add an Amazon ElastiCache 
instance in front of the ALB to reduce traffic for the API to handle. 
D. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the static content. Add an Amazon Simple Queue 
Service (Amazon SOS) queue to receive requests from the website for later processing by the 
EC2 instances. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Static content can include images and style sheets that are the same across all users and are 
best cached at the edges of the content distribution network (CDN). Dynamic content includes 
information that changes frequently or is personalized based on user preferences, behavior, 
location or other factors - all content is sales requests. 
 
 
QUESTION 453 
A company’s web application consists of an Amazon API Gateway API in front of an AWS

QUESTION 462 
A rapidly growing global ecommerce company is hosting its web application on AWS. The web 
application includes static content and dynamic content. The website stores online transaction 
processing (OLTP) data in an Amazon RDS database. The website's users are experiencing slow 
page loads. 
 
Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to resolve this issue? (Choose 
two.) 
 
A. Configure an Amazon Redshift cluster. 
B. Set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution 
C. Host the dynamic web content in Amazon S3 
D. Create a read replica for the RDS DB instance. 
E. Configure a Multi-AZ deployment for the RDS DB instance 
 
Answer: BD 
Explanation: 
To resolve the issue of slow page loads for a rapidly growing e-commerce website hosted on 
AWS, a solutions architect can take the following two actions: 
1. Set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution 
2. Create a read replica for the RDS DB instance 
 
Configuring an Amazon Redshift cluster is not relevant to this issue since Redshift is a data 
warehousing service and is typically used for the analytical processing of large amounts of data. 
Hosting the dynamic web content in Amazon S3 may not necessarily improve performance since 
S3 is an object storage service, not a web application server. While S3 can be used to host static

Explanation: 
When you create an EBS volume, you can specify whether to encrypt the volume. If you choose 
to encrypt the volume, all data written to the volume is automatically encrypted at rest using 
AWS-managed keys. You can also use customer-managed keys (CMKs) stored in AWS KMS to 
encrypt and protect your EBS volumes. You can create encrypted EBS volumes and attach them 
to EC2 instances to ensure that all data written to the volumes is encrypted at rest.

using a CNAME that points to the CloudFront DNS.v 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Q: How is AWS Global Accelerator different from Amazon CloudFront? 
A: AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS 
global network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for 
both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API 
acceleration and dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide 
range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in 
one or more AWS Regions. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as 
gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically 
require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with 
AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

D. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) queue. Send the requests to the 
queue. Configure the queue as an event source for Lambda. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
To improve the architecture of this application, the best solution would be to use Amazon Simple 
Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to buffer the requests and decouple the S3 bucket from the 
Lambda function. This will ensure that the documents are not lost and can be processed at a later 
time if the Lambda function is not available. 
 
This will ensure that the documents are not lost and can be processed at a later time if the 
Lambda function is not available. By using Amazon SQS, the architecture is decoupled and the 
Lambda function can process the documents in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner. 
 
 
QUESTION 494 
A developer has an application that uses an AWS Lambda function to upload files to Amazon S3 
and needs the required permissions to perform the task. The developer already has an IAM user 
with valid IAM credentials required for Amazon S3. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to grant the permissions? 
 
A. Add required IAM permissions in the resource policy of the Lambda function. 
B. Create a signed request using the existing IAM credentials in the Lambda function 
C. Create a new IAM user and use the existing IAM credentials in the Lambda function. 
D. Create an IAM execution role with the required permissions and attach the IAM rote to the 
Lambda function. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
To grant the necessary permissions to an AWS Lambda function to upload files to Amazon S3, a 
solutions architect should create an IAM execution role with the required permissions and attach 
the IAM role to the Lambda function. This approach follows the principle of least privilege and 
ensures that the Lambda function can only access the resources it needs to perform its specific 
task.

online. The company uses Amazon DynamoDB to store is data and wants to build a new service 
that sends an alert to the managers of four Internal teams every time a new weather event is 
recorded. The company does not want true new service to affect the performance of the current 
application. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirement with the LEAST amount of 
operational overhead? 
 
A. Use DynamoDB transactions to write new event data to the table. Configure the transactions to 
notify internal teams. 
B. Have the current application publish a message to four Amazon Simple Notification Service 
(Amazon SNS) topics. Have each team subscribe to one topic. 
C. Enable Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table. Use triggers to write to a mingle Amazon 
Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which the teams can subscribe. 
D. Add a custom attribute to each record to flag new items. Write a cron job that scans the table 
every minute for items that are new and notifies an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon 
SOS) queue to which the teams can subscribe. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The best solution to meet these requirements with the least amount of operational overhead is to 
enable Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table and use triggers to write to a single Amazon 
Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which the teams can subscribe. This solution 
requires minimal configuration and infrastructure setup, and Amazon DynamoDB Streams 
provide a low-latency way to capture changes to the DynamoDB table. The triggers automatically 
capture the changes and publish them to the SNS topic, which notifies the internal teams.

QUESTION 511 
A company hosts a frontend application that uses an Amazon API Gateway API backend that is 
integrated with AWS Lambda. When the API receives requests, the Lambda function loads many 
libraries. Then the Lambda function connects to an Amazon RDS database, processes the data, 
and returns the data to the frontend application. The company wants to ensure that response 
latency is as low as possible for all its users with the fewest number of changes to the company's 
operations. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Establish a connection between the frontend application and the database to make queries faster 
by bypassing the API. 
B. Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function that handles the requests. 
C. Cache the results of the queries in Amazon S3 for faster retrieval of similar datasets. 
D. Increase the size of the database to increase the number of connections Lambda can establish at 
one time.

250 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function that handles the requests. 
Provisioned concurrency allows you to set the amount of compute resources that are available to 
the Lambda function, so that it can handle more requests at once and reduce latency. Caching 
the results of the queries in Amazon S3 could also help to reduce latency, but it would not be as 
effective as setting up provisioned concurrency. Increasing the size of the database would not 
help to reduce latency, as this would not increase the number of connections the Lambda 
function could establish, and establishing a direct connection between the frontend application 
and the database would bypass the API, which would not be the best solution either.

A solutions architect needs to allow team members to access Amazon S3 buckets in two different 
AWS accounts: a development account and a production account. The team currently has access 
to S3 buckets in the development account by using unique IAM users that are assigned to an IAM 
group that has appropriate permissions in the account. 
 
The solutions architect has created an IAM role in the production account. The role has a policy 
that grants access to an S3 bucket in the production account. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements while complying with the principle of least privilege? 
 
A. Attach the Administrator Access policy to the development account users. 
B. Add the development account as a principal in the trust policy of the role in the production 
account. 
C. Turn off the S3 Block Public Access feature on the S3 bucket in the production account. 
D. Create a user in the production account with unique credentials for each team member. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
By adding the development account as a principal in the trust policy of the IAM role in the 
production account, you are allowing users from the development account to assume the role in 
the production account. This allows the team members to access the S3 bucket in the production 
account without granting them unnecessary privileges.

An audit discovers that employees have created Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) 
volumes for EC2 instances without encrypting the volumes. The company wants any new EC2 
instances that any IAM user or root user launches in ap-southeast-2 to use encrypted EBS 
volumes. The company wants a solution that will have minimal effect on employees who create 
EBS volumes. 
 
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 
 
A. In the Amazon EC2 console, select the EBS encryption account attribute and define a default 
encryption key. 
B. Create an IAM permission boundary. Attach the permission boundary to the root organizational 
unit (OU). Define the boundary to deny the ec2:CreateVolume action when the ec2:Encrypted 
condition equals false. 
C. Create an SCP. Attach the SCP to the root organizational unit (OU). Define the SCP to deny the 
ec2:CreateVolume action whenthe ec2:Encrypted condition equals false. 
D. Update the IAM policies for each account to deny the ec2:CreateVolume action when the 
ec2:Encrypted condition equals false. 
E. In the Organizations management account, specify the Default EBS volume encryption setting. 
 
Answer: CE

QUESTION 522 
A company is developing a new machine learning (ML) model solution on AWS. The models are 
developed as independent microservices that fetch approximately 1 GB of model data from 
Amazon S3 at startup and load the data into memory. Users access the models through an 
asynchronous API. Users can send a request or a batch of requests and specify where the 
results should be sent. 
 
The company provides models to hundreds of users. The usage patterns for the models are 
irregular. Some models could be unused for days or weeks. Other models could receive batches 
of thousands of requests at a time. 
 
Which design should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

A. Create a read replica of the database. Configure IAM standard database authentication to grant 
the auditor access. 
B. Export the database contents to text files. Store the files in an Amazon S3 bucket. Create a new 
IAM user for the auditor. Grant the user access to the S3 bucket. 
C. Copy a snapshot of the database to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an IAM user. Share the user's 
keys with the auditor to grant access to the object in the S3 bucket. 
D. Create an encrypted snapshot of the database. Share the snapshot with the auditor. Allow access 
to the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
The most secure way for the company to share the database with the auditor is option D: Create 
an encrypted snapshot of the database, share the snapshot with the auditor, and allow access to 
the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key. 
By creating an encrypted snapshot, the company ensures that the database data is protected at 
rest. Sharing the encrypted snapshot with the auditor allows them to have their own copy of the

database securely. 
In addition, granting access to the AWS KMS encryption key ensures that the auditor has the 
necessary permissions to decrypt and access the encrypted snapshot. This allows the auditor to 
restore the snapshot and access the data securely. 
This approach provides both data protection and access control, ensuring that the database is 
securely shared with the auditor while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data.

QUESTION 562 
A company has an application that processes customer orders. The company hosts the 
application on an Amazon EC2 instance that saves the orders to an Amazon Aurora database. 
Occasionally when traffic is high the workload does not process orders fast enough. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to write the orders reliably to the database as quickly as 
possible? 
 
A. Increase the instance size of the EC2 instance when traffic is high. Write orders to Amazon 
Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). Subscribe the database endpoint to the SNS topic. 
B. Write orders to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use EC2 instances in 
an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer to read from the SQS queue and 
process orders into the database. 
C. Write orders to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). Subscribe the database 
endpoint to the SNS topic. Use EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application 
Load Balancer to read from the SNS topic. 
D. Write orders to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue when the EC2 instance 
reaches CPU threshold limits. Use scheduled scaling of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group 
behind an Application Load Balancer to read from the SQS queue and process orders into the 
database. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
By decoupling the write operation from the processing operation using SQS, you ensure that the 
orders are reliably stored in the queue, regardless of the processing capacity of the EC2 
instances. This allows the processing to be performed at a scalable rate based on the available 
EC2 instances, improving the overall reliability and speed of order processing.

(ALB). The website serves static content. Website traffic is increasing, and the company is 
concerned about a potential increase in cost. 
 
A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to cache state files at edge locations 
B. Create an Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Connect the ALB to the ElastiCache cluster to serve 
cached files 
C. Create an AWS WAF web ACL and associate it with the ALB. Add a rule to the web ACL to cache 
static files 
D. Create a second ALB in an alternative AWS Region. Route user traffic to the closest Region to 
minimize data transfer costs 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Amazon CloudFront: CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that caches content 
at edge locations worldwide. By creating a CloudFront distribution, static content from the website 
can be cached at edge locations, reducing the load on the EC2 instances and improving the 
overall performance. 
Caching Static Files: Since the website serves static content, caching these files at CloudFront 
edge locations can significantly reduce the number of requests forwarded to the EC2 instances. 
This helps to lower the overall cost by offloading traffic from the instances and reducing the data 
transfer costs.

D. Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk and configure it to use an automated reference to the prototype 
infrastructure to automatically deploy new environments in two Availability Zones. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows you to define and provision infrastructure as code. 
This means that you can create a template that describes the resources you want to create, and 
then use CloudFormation to deploy those resources in an automated fashion. 
In this case, the solutions architect should define the infrastructure as a template by using the 
prototype infrastructure as a guide. The template should include resources for an Auto Scaling 
group, an Application Load Balancer, and an Amazon RDS database. Once the template is 
created, the solutions architect can use CloudFormation to deploy the infrastructure in two 
Availability Zones.

B. VPC endpoint 
C. Private subnet 
D. Virtual private gateway 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
A VPC endpoint enables you to privately access AWS services without requiring internet 
gateways, NAT gateways, VPN connections, or AWS Direct Connect connections. It allows you to 
connect your VPC directly to supported AWS services, such as Amazon S3, over a private 
connection within the AWS network. 
By creating a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, the traffic between your EC2 instances and S3 will 
stay within the AWS network and won't traverse the public internet. This provides a more secure 
and compliant solution, as the data transfer remains within the private network boundaries.

C. Ensure that the customers create an IAM user in their account with read-only EC2 and 
CloudWatch permissions. Encrypt and store customer access and secret keys in a secrets 
management system. 
D. Ensure that the customers create an Amazon Cognito user in their account to use an IAM role 
with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions. Encrypt and store the Amazon Cognito user 
and password in a secrets management system. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
By having customers create an IAM role with the necessary permissions in their own accounts, 
the company can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to establish cross-account 
access. The trust policy allows the company's AWS account to assume the customer's IAM role 
temporarily, granting access to the specified resources (EC2 instances and CloudWatch metrics) 
within the customer's account. This approach follows the principle of least privilege, as the 
company only requests the necessary permissions and does not require long-term access keys 
or user credentials from the customers.

server log files shows that the application is receiving millions of illegitimate requests from a small 
number of IP addresses. A solutions architect needs to resolve the immediate performance 
problem while the company investigates a more permanent solution. 
 
What should the solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement? 
 
A. Modify the inbound security group for the web tier. Add a deny rule for the IP addresses that are 
consuming resources. 
B. Modify the network ACL for the web tier subnets. Add an inbound deny rule for the IP addresses 
that are consuming resources. 
C. Modify the inbound security group for the application tier. Add a deny rule for the IP addresses 
that are consuming resources. 
D. Modify the network ACL for the application tier subnets. Add an inbound deny rule for the IP 
addresses that are consuming resources. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
In this scenario, the security audit reveals that the application is receiving millions of illegitimate 
requests from a small number of IP addresses. To address this issue, it is recommended to 
modify the network ACL (Access Control List) for the web tier subnets. 
By adding an inbound deny rule specifically targeting the IP addresses that are consuming 
resources, the network ACL can block the illegitimate traffic at the subnet level before it reaches 
the web servers. This will help alleviate the excessive load on the web tier and improve the 
application's performance.

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
By using Amazon S3 and AWS Lambda together, you can create a serverless architecture that 
provides highly scalable and available image resizing capabilities. Here's how the solution would 
work: 
Set up an Amazon S3 bucket to store the original images uploaded by users. 
Configure an event trigger on the S3 bucket to invoke an AWS Lambda function whenever a new 
image is uploaded. 
The Lambda function can be designed to retrieve the uploaded image, perform the necessary 
resizing operations based on device requirements, and store the resized images back in the S3 
bucket or a different bucket designated for resized images. 
Configure the Amazon S3 bucket to make the resized images publicly accessible for serving to 
users.

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Enabling storage autoscaling allows RDS to automatically adjust the storage capacity based on 
the application's needs. When the storage usage exceeds a predefined threshold, RDS will 
automatically increase the allocated storage without requiring manual intervention or causing 
downtime. This ensures that the RDS database has sufficient disk space to handle the increasing 
storage requirements.

QUESTION 621 
A retail company has several businesses. The IT team for each business manages its own AWS 
account. Each team account is part of an organization in AWS Organizations. Each team 
monitors its product inventory levels in an Amazon DynamoDB table in the team's own AWS 
account. 
 
The company is deploying a central inventory reporting application into a shared AWS account. 
The application must be able to read items from all the teams' DynamoDB tables. 
 
Which authentication option will meet these requirements MOST securely? 
 
A. Integrate DynamoDB with AWS Secrets Manager in the inventory application account. Configure 
the application to use the correct secret from Secrets Manager to authenticate and read the 
DynamoDB table. Schedule secret rotation for every 30 days. 
B. In every business account, create an IAM user that has programmatic access. Configure the 
application to use the correct IAM user access key ID and secret access key to authenticate and 
read the DynamoDB table. Manually rotate IAM access keys every 30 days. 
C. In every business account, create an IAM role named BU_ROLE with a policy that gives the role 
access to the DynamoDB table and a trust policy to trust a specific role in the inventory 
application account. In the inventory account, create a role named APP_ROLE that allows access 
to the STS AssumeRole API operation. Configure the application to use APP_ROLE and assume 
the crossaccount role BU_ROLE to read the DynamoDB table. 
D. Integrate DynamoDB with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Generate identity certificates to 
authenticate DynamoDB. Configure the application to use the correct certificate to authenticate 
and read the DynamoDB table.

303 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
IAM Roles: IAM roles provide a secure way to grant permissions to entities within AWS. By 
creating an IAM role in each business account named BU_ROLE with the necessary permissions 
to access the DynamoDB table, the access can be controlled at the IAM role level. 
Cross-Account Access: By configuring a trust policy in the BU_ROLE that trusts a specific role in 
the inventory application account (APP_ROLE), you establish a trusted relationship between the 
two accounts. 
Least Privilege: By creating a specific IAM role (BU_ROLE) in each business account and 
granting it access only to the required DynamoDB table, you can ensure that each team's table is 
accessed with the least privilege principle. 
Security Token Service (STS): The use of STS AssumeRole API operation in the inventory 
application account allows the application to assume the cross-account role (BU_ROLE) in each 
business account.

In a canary release deployment, total API traffic is separated at random into a production release 
and a canary release with a pre-configured ratio. Typically, the canary release receives a small 
percentage of API traffic and the production release takes up the rest. The updated API features 
are only visible to API traffic through the canary. You can adjust the canary traffic percentage to 
optimize test coverage or performance.

QUESTION 649 
A company is using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys to encrypt AWS Lambda 
environment variables. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the required permissions are in 
place to decrypt and use the environment variables. 
 
Which steps must the solutions architect take to implement the correct permissions? (Choose 
two.) 
 
A. Add AWS KMS permissions in the Lambda resource policy. 
B. Add AWS KMS permissions in the Lambda execution role. 
C. Add AWS KMS permissions in the Lambda function policy. 
D. Allow the Lambda execution role in the AWS KMS key policy. 
E. Allow the Lambda resource policy in the AWS KMS key policy. 
 
Answer: BD 
Explanation: 
To decrypt environment variables encrypted with AWS KMS, Lambda needs to be granted 
permissions to call KMS APIs. This is done in two places: 
The Lambda execution role needs kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey permissions added. 
The execution role governs what AWS services the function code can access. 
The KMS key policy needs to allow the Lambda execution role to have kms:Decrypt and 
kms:GenerateDataKey permissions for that specific key. This allows the execution role to use that

A. Configure Amazon Macie in each Region. Create a job to analyze the data that is in Amazon S3. 
B. Configure AWS Security Hub for all Regions. Create an AWS Config rule to analyze the data that 
is in Amazon S3. 
C. Configure Amazon Inspector to analyze the data that is in Amazon S3. 
D. Configure Amazon GuardDuty to analyze the data that is in Amazon S3. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Amazon Macie is designed specifically for discovering and classifying sensitive data like PII in S3. 
This makes it the optimal service to use. 
Macie can be enabled directly in the required Regions rather than enabling it across all Regions 
which is unnecessary. This minimizes overhead. 
Macie can be set up to automatically scan the specified S3 buckets on a schedule. No need to 
create separate jobs. 
Security Hub is for security monitoring across AWS accounts, not specific for PII discovery. More 
overhead than needed. 
Inspector and GuardDuty are not built for PII discovery in S3 buckets. They provide broader 
security capabilities. 
 
 
QUESTION 653 
A company's SAP application has a backend SQL Server database in an on-premises 
environment. The company wants to migrate its on-premises application and database server to 
AWS. The company needs an instance type that meets the high demands of its SAP database. 
On-premises performance data shows that both the SAP application and the database have high 
memory utilization. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Use the compute optimized instance family for the application. Use the memory optimized 
instance family for the database. 
B. Use the storage optimized instance family for both the application and the database. 
C. Use the memory optimized instance family for both the application and the database. 
D. Use the high performance computing (HPC) optimized instance family for the application. Use the 
memory optimized instance family for the database. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Since both the app and database have high memory needs, the memory optimized family like R5 
instances meet those requirements well. 
Using the same instance family simplifies management and operations, rather than mixing 
instance types. 
Compute optimized instances may not provide enough memory for the SAP app's needs. 
Storage optimized is overkill for the database's compute and memory needs. 
HPC is overprovisioned for the SAP app. 
 
 
QUESTION 654

Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the private 
subnets. Add to the endpoint a security group that has an inbound access rule that allows traffic 
from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets. 
B. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the public 
subnets. Attach to the interface endpoint a VPC endpoint policy that allows access from the EC2 
instances that are in the private subnets. 
C. Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the public 
subnets. Attach an Amazon SQS access policy to the interface VPC endpoint that allows 
requests from only a specified VPC endpoint. 
D. Implement a gateway endpoint for Amazon SQS. Add a NAT gateway to the private subnets. 
Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instances that allows access to the SQS queue. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
An interface VPC endpoint is a private way to connect to AWS services without having to expose 
your VPC to the public internet. This is the most secure way to connect to Amazon SQS from the 
private subnets. 
Configuring the endpoint to use the private subnets ensures that the traffic between the EC2 
instances and the SQS queue is only within the VPC. This helps to protect the traffic from being 
intercepted by a malicious actor. 
Adding a security group to the endpoint that has an inbound access rule that allows traffic from 
the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets further restricts the traffic to only the authorized 
sources. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to the SQS queue. 
 
 
QUESTION 655 
A solutions architect is using an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy a three-tier web 
application. The web application consists of a web tier and an application tier that stores and 
retrieves user data in Amazon DynamoDB tables. The web and application tiers are hosted on 
Amazon EC2 instances, and the database tier is not publicly accessible. The application EC2 
instances need to access the DynamoDB tables without exposing API credentials in the template. 
 
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Create an IAM role to read the DynamoDB tables. Associate the role with the application 
instances by referencing an instance profile. 
B. Create an IAM role that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB 
tables. Add the role to the EC2 instance profile, and associate the instance profile with the 
application instances. 
C. Use the parameter section in the AWS CloudFormation template to have the user input access 
and secret keys from an already-created IAM user that has the required permissions to read and 
write from the DynamoDB tables. 
D. Create an IAM user in the AWS CloudFormation template that has the required permissions to 
read and write from the DynamoDB tables. Use the GetAtt function to retrieve the access and 
secret keys, and pass them to the application instances through the user data. 
 
Answer: B

information that is stored in an Amazon Redshift database to enrich the data. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Use Amazon Athena to process the S3 data. Use AWS Glue with the Amazon Redshift data to 
enrich the S3 data. 
B. Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon EMR with the Amazon Redshift data to 
enrich the S3 data. 
C. Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to move the S3 
data into Amazon Redshift so that the data can be enriched. 
D. Use AWS Glue to process the S3 data. Use AWS Lake Formation with the Amazon Redshift data 
to enrich the S3 data. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Use Amazon EMR to process the semi-structured data in Amazon S3. EMR provides a managed 
Hadoop framework optimized for processing large datasets in S3. 
EMR supports parallel data processing across multiple nodes to speed up the processing. 
EMR can integrate directly with Amazon Redshift using the EMR-Redshift integration. This allows 
querying the Redshift data from EMR and joining it with the S3 data. 
This enables enriching the semi-structured S3 data with the information stored in Redshift. 
 
 
QUESTION 657 
A company has two VPCs that are located in the us-west-2 Region within the same AWS 
account. The company needs to allow network traffic between these VPCs. Approximately 500 
GB of data transfer will occur between the VPCs each month. 
 
What is the MOST cost-effective solution to connect these VPCs? 
 
A. Implement AWS Transit Gateway to connect the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to 
use the transit gateway for inter-VPC communication. 
B. Implement an AWS Site-to-Site VPN tunnel between the VPCs. Update the route tables of each 
VPC to use the VPN tunnel for inter-VPC communication. 
C. Set up a VPC peering connection between the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to use 
the VPC peering connection for inter-VPC communication. 
D. Set up a 1 GB AWS Direct Connect connection between the VPCs. Update the route tables of 
each VPC to use the Direct Connect connection for inter-VPC communication. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
VPC peering provides private connectivity between VPCs without using public IP space. 
Data transferred between peered VPCs is free as long as they are in the same region. 
500 GB/month inter-VPC data transfer fits within peering free tier. 
Transit Gateway (Option A) incurs hourly charges plus data transfer fees. More costly than 
peering. 
Site-to-Site VPN (Option B) incurs hourly charges and data transfer fees. More expensive than 
peering. 
Direct Connect (Option D) has high hourly charges and would be overkill for this use case.

Organizations across multiple AWS Regions. Teams for each product line have tagged each 
compute resource in the individual accounts. 
 
The company wants more details about the cost for each product line from the consolidated 
billing feature in Organizations. 
 
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 
 
A. Select a specific AWS generated tag in the AWS Billing console. 
B. Select a specific user-defined tag in the AWS Billing console. 
C. Select a specific user-defined tag in the AWS Resource Groups console. 
D. Activate the selected tag from each AWS account. 
E. Activate the selected tag from the Organizations management account. 
 
Answer: BE 
Explanation: 
User-defined tags were created by each product team to identify resources. Selecting the 
relevant tag in the Billing console will group costs. 
The tag must be activated from the Organizations management account to consolidate billing 
across all accounts. 
AWS generated tags are predefined by AWS and won't align to product lines. 
Resource Groups (Option C) helps manage resources but not billing. 
Activating the tag from each account (Option D) is not needed since Organizations centralizes 
billing. 
 
 
QUESTION 659

when retrieving product details from the Amazon DynamoDB table. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead? 
 
A. Set up a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster. Route all read requests through DAX. 
B. Set up Amazon ElastiCache for Redis between the DynamoDB table and the web application. 
Route all read requests through Redis. 
C. Set up Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached between the DynamoDB table and the web 
application. Route all read requests through Memcached. 
D. Set up Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table, and have AWS Lambda read from the table 
and populate Amazon ElastiCache. Route all read requests through ElastiCache. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
DAX provides a DynamoDB-compatible caching layer to reduce read latency. It is purpose-built 
for accelerating DynamoDB workloads. 
Using DAX requires minimal application changes - only read requests are routed through it. 
DAX handles caching logic automatically without needing complex integration code. 
ElastiCache Redis/Memcached (Options B/C) require more integration work to sync DynamoDB 
data. 
Using Lambda and Streams to populate ElastiCache (Option D) is a complex event-driven 
approach requiring ongoing maintenance. 
DAX plugs in seamlessly to accelerate DynamoDB with very little operational overhead.

QUESTION 663 
A company is building an ecommerce application and needs to store sensitive customer 
information. The company needs to give customers the ability to complete purchase transactions 
on the website. The company also needs to ensure that sensitive customer data is protected, 
even from database administrators. 
 
Which solution meets these requirements? 
 
A. Store sensitive data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Use EBS 
encryption to encrypt the data. Use an IAM instance role to restrict access. 
B. Store sensitive data in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS 
KMS) client-side encryption to encrypt the data. 
C. Store sensitive data in Amazon S3. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) server-side 
encryption to encrypt the data. Use S3 bucket policies to restrict access. 
D. Store sensitive data in Amazon FSx for Windows Server. Mount the file share on application 
servers. Use Windows file permissions to restrict access. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
RDS MySQL provides a fully managed database service well suited for an ecommerce 
application. 
AWS KMS client-side encryption allows encrypting sensitive data before it hits the database. The 
data remains encrypted at rest. 
This protects sensitive customer data from database admins and privileged users. 
EBS encryption (Option A) protects data at rest but not in use. IAM roles don't prevent admin 
access. 
S3 (Option C) encrypts data at rest on the server side. Bucket policies don't restrict admin 
access. 
FSx file permissions (Option D) don't prevent admin access to unencrypted data. 
 
 
QUESTION 664

A. Use native MySQL tools to migrate the database to Amazon RDS for MySQL. Configure elastic 
storage scaling. 
B. Migrate the database to Amazon Redshift by using the mysqldump utility. Turn on Auto Scaling 
for the Amazon Redshift cluster. 
C. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate the database to Amazon Aurora. 
Turn on Aurora Auto Scaling. 
D. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate the database to Amazon 
DynamoDB. Configure an Auto Scaling policy. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
DMS provides an easy migration path from MySQL to Aurora while minimizing downtime. 
Aurora is a MySQL-compatible relational database service that will maintain compatibility with the 
company's applications. 
Aurora Auto Scaling allows the database to automatically scale up and down based on demand 
to handle increased workloads. 
RDS MySQL (Option A) does not scale as well as the Aurora architecture. 
Redshift (Option B) is for analytics, not transactional data, and may not be compatible. 
DynamoDB (Option D) is a NoSQL datastore and lacks MySQL compatibility. 
 
 
QUESTION 665 
A company runs multiple Amazon EC2 Linux instances in a VPC across two Availability Zones. 
The instances host applications that use a hierarchical directory structure. The applications need 
to read and write rapidly and concurrently to shared storage. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements? 
 
A. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Allow access from all the EC2 instances in the VPC. 
B. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system 
from each EC2 instance. 
C. Create a file system on a Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon 
EBS) volume. Attach the EBS volume to all the EC2 instances. 
D. Create file systems on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are attached to 
each EC2 instance. Synchronize the EBS volumes across the different EC2 instances. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
How is Amazon EFS different than Amazon S3? 
Amazon EFS provides shared access to data using a traditional file sharing permissions model 
and hierarchical directory structure via the NFSv4 protocol. Applications that access data using a 
standard file system interface provided through the operating system can use Amazon EFS to 
take advantage of the scalability and reliability of file storage in the cloud without writing any new 
code or adjusting applications. 
Amazon S3 is an object storage platform that uses a simple API for storing and accessing data. 
Applications that do not require a file system structure and are designed to work with object 
storage can use Amazon S3 as a massively scalable, durable, low-cost object storage solution.

B. Provision an Amazon Aurora database with a minimum capacity of 1 Aurora capacity unit (ACU). 
C. Provision an Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 database with a minimum capacity of 1 Aurora 
capacity unit (ACU). 
D. Provision an Amazon RDS for MySQL database with 2 GiB of memory. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Aurora Serverless v2 provides auto-scaling so the database can handle inconsistent workloads 
and spikes automatically without admin intervention. 
It can scale down to zero when not in use to minimize costs. 
The minimum 1 ACU capacity is sufficient to replace the on-prem 2 GiB database based on the 
info given. 
Serverless capabilities reduce admin overhead for capacity management. 
DynamoDB lacks MySQL compatibility and requires more hands-on management. 
RDS and provisioned Aurora require manually resizing instances to scale, increasing admin 
overhead.

https://www.passleader.com  
326 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Aurora Serverless v2 scales compute capacity automatically based on actual usage, down to 
zero when not in use. This minimizes costs for intermittent usage. 
Since it only runs for 2 hours per week, the application is ideal for a serverless architecture like 
Aurora Serverless. 
Aurora Serverless v2 charges per second when the database is active, unlike RDS which 
charges hourly. 
Aurora Serverless provides higher availability than self-managed MySQL on EC2 or ECS. 
Using reserved EC2 instances or ECS still incurs charges when not in use versus the fine-grained 
scaling of serverless. 
Standard Aurora clusters have a minimum capacity unlike the auto-scaling serverless 
architecture.

QUESTION 676 
A company uses an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve content pages for its website. The 
company needs to ensure that clients use a TLS certificate when accessing the company's 
website. The company wants to automate the creation and renewal of the TLS certificates. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency? 
 
A. Use a CloudFront security policy to create a certificate. 
B. Use a CloudFront origin access control (OAC) to create a certificate. 
C. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create a certificate. Use DNS validation for the domain. 
D. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create a certificate. Use email validation for the domain. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) provides free public TLS/SSL certificates and handles certificate 
renewals automatically. 
Using DNS validation with ACM is operationally efficient since it automatically makes changes to 
Route 53 rather than requiring manual validation steps. 
ACM integrates natively with CloudFront distributions for delivering HTTPS content. 
CloudFront security policies and origin access controls do not issue TLS certificates. 
Email validation requires manual steps to approve the domain validation emails for each renewal.

B. Group the EC2 instances in separate accounts. 
C. Configure the EC2 instances with dedicated tenancy. 
D. Configure the EC2 instances with shared tenancy. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Configuring the EC2 instances with dedicated tenancy ensures that each instance will run on 
isolated, single-tenant hardware. This meets the requirement to prevent groups of nodes from 
sharing underlying hardware. 
A spread placement group only provides isolation at the Availability Zone level. Instances could 
still share hardware within an AZ.

QUESTION 687 
An ecommerce company wants a disaster recovery solution for its Amazon RDS DB instances 
that run Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition. The company's current recovery point objective 
(RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) are 24 hours. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 
 
A. Create a cross-Region read replica and promote the read replica to the primary instance. 
B. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create RDS cross-Region replication. 
C. Use cross-Region replication every 24 hours to copy native backups to an Amazon S3 bucket. 
D. Copy automatic snapshots to another Region every 24 hours. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of your DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster 
during the backup window of your DB instance. RDS creates a storage volume snapshot of your 
DB instance, backing up the entire DB instance and not just individual databases. RDS saves the 
automated backups of your DB instance according to the backup retention period that you 
specify. If necessary, you can recover your DB instance to any point in time during the backup 
retention period.

B. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis to store the session state. Update the application to use 
ElastiCache for Redis to store the session state. 
C. Use an AWS Storage Gateway cached volume to store session data. Update the application to 
use AWS Storage Gateway cached volume to store the session state. 
D. Use Amazon RDS to store the session state. Update the application to use Amazon RDS to store 
the session state. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
ElastiCache Redis provides in-memory caching that can deliver microsecond latency for session 
data. 
Redis supports replication and multi-AZ which can provide high availability for the cache. 
The application can be updated to store session data in ElastiCache Redis rather than locally on 
the web servers. 
If a web server fails, the user can be routed via the load balancer to another web server which 
can retrieve their session data from the highly available ElastiCache Redis cluster.

D. Availability of the Outposts infrastructure including the power supplies, servers, and networking 
equipment within the Outposts racks 
E. Physical maintenance of Outposts components 
F. Providing extra capacity for Amazon ECS clusters to mitigate server failures and maintenance 
events 
 
Answer: ACF 
Explanation: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-outposts-high-availability-design/aws-
outposts-high-availability-design.html 
With Outposts, you are responsible for providing resilient power and network connectivity to the 
Outpost racks to meet your availability requirements for workloads running on Outposts. You are 
responsible for the physical security and access controls of the data center environment. You 
must provide sufficient power, space, and cooling to keep the Outpost operational and network 
connections to connect the Outpost back to the Region. Since Outpost capacity is finite and 
determined by the size and number of racks AWS installs at your site, you must decide how much 
EC2, EBS, and S3 on Outposts capacity you need to run your initial workloads, accommodate 
future growth, and to provide extra capacity to mitigate server failures and maintenance events. 
 
 
QUESTION 699 
A company is planning to migrate a TCP-based application into the company's VPC. The 
application is publicly accessible on a nonstandard TCP port through a hardware appliance in the 
company's data center. This public endpoint can process up to 3 million requests per second with 
low latency. The company requires the same level of performance for the new public endpoint in 
AWS. 
 
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement? 
 
A. Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Configure the NLB to be publicly accessible over the 
TCP port that the application requires. 
B. Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Configure the ALB to be publicly accessible over the 
TCP port that the application requires. 
C. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution that listens on the TCP port that the application 
requires. Use an Application Load Balancer as the origin. 
D. Deploy an Amazon API Gateway API that is configured with the TCP port that the application 
requires. Configure AWS Lambda functions with provisioned concurrency to process the 
requests. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Since the company requires the same level of performance for the new public endpoint in AWS. 
A Network Load Balancer functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 
model. It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a 
connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule. It attempts to 
open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.

QUESTION 701 
A company's infrastructure consists of hundreds of Amazon EC2 instances that use Amazon 
Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage. A solutions architect must ensure that every EC2 
instance can be recovered after a disaster. 
 
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement with the LEAST amount of effort? 
 
A. Take a snapshot of the EBS storage that is attached to each EC2 instance. Create an AWS 
CloudFormation template to launch new EC2 instances from the EBS storage. 
B. Take a snapshot of the EBS storage that is attached to each EC2 instance. Use AWS Elastic 
Beanstalk to set the environment based on the EC2 template and attach the EBS storage. 
C. Use AWS Backup to set up a backup plan for the entire group of EC2 instances. Use the AWS 
Backup API or the AWS CLI to speed up the restore process for multiple EC2 instances. 
D. Create an AWS Lambda function to take a snapshot of the EBS storage that is attached to each 
EC2 instance and copy the Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Create another Lambda function to 
perform the restores with the copied AMIs and attach the EBS storage. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
AWS Backup automates backup of resources like EBS volumes. It allows defining backup 
policies for groups of resources. This removes the need to manually create backups for each 
resource. 
The AWS Backup API and CLI allow programmatic control of backup plans and restores. This 
enables restoring hundreds of EC2 instances programmatically after a disaster instead of 
manually. 
AWS Backup handles cleanup of old backups based on policies to minimize storage costs.

A. Use the AWS Step Functions Map state in Inline mode to process the data in parallel. 
B. Use the AWS Step Functions Map state in Distributed mode to process the data in parallel. 
C. Use AWS Glue to process the data in parallel. 
D. Use several AWS Lambda functions to process the data in parallel. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
AWS Step Functions allows you to orchestrate and scale distributed processing using the Map 
state. The Map state can process items in a large dataset in parallel by distributing the work 
across multiple resources. 
Using the Map state in Distributed mode will automatically handle the parallel processing and 
scaling. Step Functions will add more workers to process the data as needed. 
Step Functions is serverless so there are no servers to manage. It will scale up and down 
automatically based on demand.

Purpose SSD Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage. The application is designed to 
process and store documents in the database as binary large objects (blobs) with an average 
document size of 6 MB. 
 
The database size has grown over time, reducing the performance and increasing the cost of 
storage. The company must improve the database performance and needs a solution that is 
highly available and resilient. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 
 
A. Reduce the RDS DB instance size. Increase the storage capacity to 24 TiB. Change the storage 
type to Magnetic. 
B. Increase the RDS DB instance size. Increase the storage capacity to 24 TiChange the storage 
type to Provisioned IOPS. 
C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Update the application to store documents in the S3 bucket. Store 
the object metadata in the existing database. 
D. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Update the application to use DynamoDB. Use AWS 
Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate data from the Oracle database to 
DynamoDB.

QUESTION 707 
A company has an application that serves clients that are deployed in more than 20.000 retail 
storefront locations around the world. The application consists of backend web services that are 
exposed over HTTPS on port 443. The application is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances behind 
an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The retail locations communicate with the web application 
over the public internet. The company allows each retail location to register the IP address that 
the retail location has been allocated by its local ISP. 
 
The company's security team recommends to increase the security of the application endpoint by 
restricting access to only the IP addresses registered by the retail locations. 
 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

QUESTION 708 
A company is building a data analysis platform on AWS by using AWS Lake Formation. The 
platform will ingest data from different sources such as Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS. The 
company needs a secure solution to prevent access to portions of the data that contain sensitive 
information. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 
 
A. Create an IAM role that includes permissions to access Lake Formation tables. 
B. Create data filters to implement row-level security and cell-level security. 
C. Create an AWS Lambda function that removes sensitive information before Lake Formation 
ingests the data. 
D. Create an AWS Lambda function that periodically queries and removes sensitive information from 
Lake Formation tables. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Lake Formation data filters allow restricting access to rows or cells in data tables based on 
conditions. This allows preventing access to sensitive data. 
Data filters are implemented within Lake Formation and do not require additional coding or 
Lambda functions. 
Lambda functions to pre-process data or purge tables would require ongoing development and 
maintenance. 
IAM roles only provide user-level permissions, not row or cell level security. 
Data filters give granular access control over Lake Formation data with minimal configuration, 
avoiding complex custom code. 
 
 
QUESTION 709 
A company deploys Amazon EC2 instances that run in a VPC. The EC2 instances load source 
data into Amazon S3 buckets so that the data can be processed in the future. According to 
compliance laws, the data must not be transmitted over the public internet. Servers in the 
company's on-premises data center will consume the output from an application that runs on the 
EC2 instances. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Deploy an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon EC2. Create an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection

QUESTION 710 
A company has an application with a REST-based interface that allows data to be received in 
near-real time from a third-party vendor. Once received, the application processes and stores the 
data for further analysis. The application is running on Amazon EC2 instances. 
 
The third-party vendor has received many 503 Service Unavailable Errors when sending data to 
the application. When the data volume spikes, the compute capacity reaches its maximum limit 
and the application is unable to process all requests. 
 
Which design should a solutions architect recommend to provide a more scalable solution? 
 
A. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest the data. Process the data using AWS Lambda 
functions. 
B. Use Amazon API Gateway on top of the existing application. Create a usage plan with a quota 
limit for the third-party vendor. 
C. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to ingest the data. Put the EC2 instances 
in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer. 
D. Repackage the application as a container. Deploy the application using Amazon Elastic Container 
Service (Amazon ECS) using the EC2 launch type with an Auto Scaling group. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Kinesis Data Streams provides an auto-scaling stream that can handle large amounts of 
streaming data ingestion and throughput. This removes the bottlenecks around receiving the 
data. 
AWS Lambda can process and store the data in a scalable serverless manner, avoiding EC2 
capacity limits. 
API Gateway adds API management capabilities but does not improve the underlying scalability 
of the EC2 application. 
SNS is for event publishing/notifications, not large scale data ingestion. ECS still relies on EC2 
capacity. 
 
 
QUESTION 711

QUESTION 713 
A company is designing a new multi-tier web application that consists of the following 
components: 
 
- Web and application servers that run on Amazon EC2 instances as part 
of Auto Scaling groups 
- An Amazon RDS DB instance for data storage 
 
A solutions architect needs to limit access to the application servers so that only the web servers 
can access them. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Deploy AWS PrivateLink in front of the application servers. Configure the network ACL to allow 
only the web servers to access the application servers. 
B. Deploy a VPC endpoint in front of the application servers. Configure the security group to allow 
only the web servers to access the application servers.

servers. 
D. Deploy an Application Load Balancer with a target group that contains the application servers' 
Auto Scaling group. Configure the security group to allow only the web servers to access the 
application servers. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
An Application Load Balancer (ALB) allows directing traffic to the application servers and provides 
access control via security groups. 
Security groups act as a firewall at the instance level and can control access to the application 
servers from the web servers. 
Network ACLs work at the subnet level and are less flexible for security groups for instance-level 
access control. 
VPC endpoints are used to provide private access to AWS services, not for access between EC2 
instances. 
AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, which is not required in this single 
VPC scenario.

A. Configure Amazon Macie to monitor and report findings to AWS Config. 
B. Configure Amazon Inspector to monitor and report findings to AWS CloudTrail. 
C. Configure Amazon GuardDuty to monitor and report findings to AWS Security Hub. 
D. Configure AWS Config to monitor and report findings to Amazon EventBridge. 
 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity 
and unauthorized behavior. It analyzes AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. 
GuardDuty can detect threats like instance or S3 bucket compromise, malicious IP addresses, or 
unusual API calls. 
Findings can be sent to AWS Security Hub which provides a centralized security dashboard and 
alerts. 
Amazon Macie and Amazon Inspector do not monitor the breadth of activity that GuardDuty does. 
They focus more on data security and application vulnerabilities respectively. 
AWS Config monitors for resource configuration changes, not malicious activity. 
 
 
QUESTION 716 
A company wants to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS. The data center hosts a 
storage server that stores data in an NFS-based file system. The storage server holds 200 GB of 
data. The company needs to migrate the data without interruption to existing services. Multiple 
resources in AWS must be able to access the data by using the NFS protocol. 
 
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.) 
 
A. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. 
B. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. 
C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to receive the data. 
D. Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data into the AWS destination. 
E. Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center. Use a DataSync task between 
the on-premises location and AWS. 
 
Answer: BE 
Explanation: 
Amazon EFS provides a scalable, high performance NFS file system that can be accessed from 
multiple resources in AWS. 
AWS DataSync can perform the migration from the on-prem NFS server to EFS without 
interruption to existing services. 
This avoids having to manually move the data which could cause downtime. DataSync 
incrementally syncs changed data. 
EFS and DataSync together provide a cost-optimized approach compared to using S3 or FSx, 
while still meeting the requirements. 
Manually copying 200 GB of data to AWS would be slow and risky compared to using DataSync.

QUESTION 773 
A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. The 
application uses a database that runs on an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. The 
application performs slowly when traffic increases. The database experiences a heavy read load 
during periods of high traffic. 
 
Which actions should a solutions architect take to resolve these performance issues? (Choose 
two.) 
 
A. Turn on auto scaling for the DB instance. 
B. Create a read replica for the DB instance. Configure the application to send read traffic to the 
read replica. 
C. Convert the DB instance to a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. Configure the application to send 
read traffic to the standby DB instance. 
D. Create an Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Configure the application to cache query results in the 
ElastiCache cluster. 
E. Configure the Auto Scaling group subnets to ensure that the EC2 instances are provisioned in the 
same Availability Zone as the DB instance. 
 
Answer: BD 
Explanation: 
By creating a read replica, you offload read traffic from the primary DB instance to the replica, 
distributing the load and improving overall performance during periods of heavy read traffic. 
Amazon ElastiCache can be used to cache frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the 
database. This is particularly effective for read-heavy workloads, as it allows the application to 
retrieve data from the cache rather than making repeated database queries.

QUESTION 782 
A company is migrating its multi-tier on-premises application to AWS. The application consists of 
a single-node MySQL database and a multi-node web tier. The company must minimize changes 
to the application during the migration. The company wants to improve application resiliency after 
the migration. 
 
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.) 
 
A. Migrate the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application 
Load Balancer. 
B. Migrate the database to Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind a Network Load 
Balancer. 
C. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment. 
D. Migrate the web tier to an AWS Lambda function. 
E. Migrate the database to an Amazon DynamoDB table. 
 
Answer: AC 
Explanation: 
Web Tier Migration (Option A): Migrating the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto 
Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) provides horizontal scalability, 
automatic scaling, and improved resiliency. Auto Scaling helps in managing and maintaining the 
desired number of EC2 instances based on demand, and the ALB distributes incoming traffic 
across multiple instances. 
Database Migration to Amazon RDS Multi-AZ (Option C): Migrating the database to Amazon RDS 
in a Multi-AZ deployment provides high availability and automatic failover. In a Multi-AZ 
deployment, Amazon RDS maintains a standby replica in a different Availability Zone, and in the 
event of a failure, it automatically promotes the replica to the primary instance. This enhances the 
resiliency of the database.

When you add an internal Load Balancer or an Amazon EC2 instance endpoint in AWS Global 
Accelerator, you enable internet traffic to flow directly to and from the endpoint in Virtual Private 
Clouds (VPCs) by targeting it in a private subnet. The VPC that contains the load balancer or 
EC2 instance must have an internet gateway attached to it, to indicate that the VPC accepts 
internet traffic. However, you don't need public IP addresses on the load balancer or EC2 
instance. You also don't need an associated internet gateway route for the subnet.

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Target groups are just a group of Ec2 instances. Target groups are closely associated with ELB 
and not ASG. We can just use ELB and Target groups to route requests to EC2 instances. With 
this setup, there is no autoscaling which means instances cannot be added or removed when 
your load increases/decreases.

QUESTION 982 
A company has deployed a multi-account strategy on AWS by using AWS Control Tower. The 
company has provided individual AWS accounts to each of its developers. The company wants to 
implement controls to limit AWS resource costs that the developers incur. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 
 
A. Instruct each developer to tag all their resources with a tag that has a key of CostCenter and a 
value of the developer's name. Use the required-tags AWS Config managed rule to check for the 
tag. Create an AWS Lambda function to terminate resources that do not have the tag. Configure 
AWS Cost Explorer to send a daily report to each developer to monitor their spending. 
B. Use AWS Budgets to establish budgets for each developer account. Set up budget alerts for 
actual and forecast values to notify developers when they exceed or expect to exceed their 
assigned budget. Use AWS Budgets actions to apply a DenyAll policy to the developer's IAM role 
to prevent additional resources from being launched when the assigned budget is reached. 
C. Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor and report on costs for each developer account. Configure 
Cost Explorer to send a daily report to each developer to monitor their spending. Use AWS Cost 
Anomaly Detection to detect anomalous spending and provide alerts. 
D. Use AWS Service Catalog to allow developers to launch resources within a limited cost range. 
Create AWS Lambda functions in each AWS account to stop running resources at the end of 
each work day. Configure the Lambda functions to resume the resources at the start of each work 
day. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Taking into consideration that AWS Budgets is allowing to will inform you that you exceeded 
budged and execute actions like for example IAM actions to prevent running new resources in 
cloud, I think this option is a good and resonable move. In case of need budged can be always 
increased and "chains" disabled.

security group for the web tier. 
F. Configure the security group for the application tier to allow outbound HTTPS traffic and Microsoft 
SQL Server traffic to the security group for the web tier. 
 
Answer: ACE 
Explanation: 
Security Group is protecting instances, it's statefull. by defoult is allowing for outgoing traffic but 
not incomming. 
hence we need to allow for inboud traffic. path looks like below 
ALB >>HTTPS>> WEB tier >>HTTPS>> Application >>SQL traffic>> SQL DB 
hence we need allow for 
incoming https traffic on web tier 
then 
incomming http on app tier 
and on the end for 
incomming sql traffic on DB tier

QUESTION 995 
A company is designing its production application's disaster recovery (DR) strategy. The 
application is backed by a MySQL database on an Amazon Aurora cluster in the us-east-1 
Region. The company has chosen the us-west-1 Region as its DR Region.

D. Create a new Aurora cluster in us-west-1. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to 
sync both clusters. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Cross-Region disaster recovery 
If your primary Region suffers a performance degradation or outage, you can promote one of the 
secondary Regions to take read/write responsibilities. An Aurora cluster can recover in less than 
1 minute, even in the event of a complete Regional outage. This provides your application with an 
effective recovery point objective (RPO) of 1 second and a recovery time objective (RTO) of less 
than 1 minute, providing a strong foundation for a global business continuity plan.

group that allows SSH access from the bastion host. Provide each external support engineer an 
SSH key pair to log in to the application instances. Provide local account IAM user credentials to 
the engineers for console access. 
 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Systems Manager Session Manager allows secure, auditable, and controlled access to your EC2 
instances without needing to open SSH ports or manage SSH keys, reducing the attack surface. 
Local IAM user credentials are less secure and harder to manage at scale compared to using 
IAM Identity Center. 
 
 
QUESTION 1008 
A company uses Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL to run its applications in the us-east-1 Region. 
The company also uses machine learning (ML) models to forecast annual revenue based on near 
real-time reports. The reports are generated by using the same RDS for PostgreSQL database. 
The database performance slows during business hours. The company needs to improve 
database performance. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 
 
A. Create a cross-Region read replica. Configure the reports to be generated from the read replica. 
B. Activate Multi-AZ DB instance deployment for RDS for PostgreSQL. Configure the reports to be 
generated from the standby database. 
C. Use AWS Data Migration Service (AWS DMS) to logically replicate data to a new database. 
Configure the reports to be generated from the new database. 
D. Create a read replica in us-east-1. Configure the reports to be generated from the read replica. 
 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Read replicas are typically less expensive than setting up a cross-Region replica or activating 
Multi-AZ deployments. You only pay for the additional read replica, without the overhead costs 
associated with cross-Region data transfer or maintaining a synchronous standby in Multi-AZ 
setups.

QUESTION 1015 
A company is designing an application on AWS that processes sensitive data. The application 
stores and processes financial data for multiple customers. 
 
To meet compliance requirements, the data for each customer must be encrypted separately at 
rest by using a secure, centralized key management solution. The company wants to use AWS 
Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to implement encryption. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 
 
A. Generate a unique encryption key for each customer. Store the keys in an Amazon S3 bucket. 
Enable server-side encryption. 
B. Deploy a hardware security appliance in the AWS environment that securely stores customer-
provided encryption keys. Integrate the security appliance with AWS KMS to encrypt the sensitive 
data in the application. 
C. Create a single AWS KMS key to encrypt all sensitive data across the application.

through an asynchronous API. Users can send a request or a batch of requests. 
 
The company provides the ML models to hundreds of users. The usage patterns for the models 
are irregular. Some models are not used for days or weeks. Other models receive batches of 
thousands of requests at a time. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements? 
 
A. Direct the requests from the API to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Deploy the ML models as 
AWS Lambda functions that the NLB will invoke. Use auto scaling to scale the Lambda functions 
based on the traffic that the NLB receives. 
B. Direct the requests from the API to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy the ML models 
as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that the ALB will invoke. Use auto 
scaling to scale the ECS cluster instances based on the traffic that the ALB receives. 
C. Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. 
Deploy the ML models as AWS Lambda functions that SQS events will invoke. Use auto scaling 
to increase the number of vCPUs for the Lambda functions based on the size of the SQS queue. 
D. Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. 
Deploy the ML models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read

QUESTION 1061 
A company uses an Amazon DynamoDB table to store data that the company receives from 
devices. The DynamoDB table supports a customer-facing website to display recent activity on 
customer devices. The company configured the table with provisioned throughput for writes and 
reads.

QUESTION 1080 
A company is building a cloud-based application on AWS that will handle sensitive customer 
data. The application uses Amazon RDS for the database, Amazon S3 for object storage, and S3 
Event Notifications that invoke AWS Lambda for serverless processing. 
 
The company uses AWS IAM Identity Center to manage user credentials. The development, 
testing, and operations teams need secure access to Amazon RDS and Amazon S3 while 
ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive customer data. The solution must comply with the 
principle of least privilege. 
 
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 
 
A. Use IAM roles with least privilege to grant all the teams access. Assign IAM roles to each team 
with customized IAM policies defining specific permission for Amazon RDS and S3 object access 
based on team responsibilities. 
B. Enable IAM Identity Center with an Identity Center directory. Create and configure permission 
sets with granular access to Amazon RDS and Amazon S3. Assign all the teams to groups that 
have specific access with the permission sets. 
C. Create individual IAM users for each member in all the teams with role-based permissions. 
Assign the IAM roles with predefined policies for RDS and S3 access to each user based on user 
needs. Implement IAM Access Analyzer for periodic credential evaluation. 
D. Use AWS Organizations to create separate accounts for each team. Implement cross-account 
IAM roles with least privilege. Grant specific permission for RDS and S3 access based on team 
roles and responsibilities. 
 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
IAM Identity Center: This service simplifies user management by centralizing credentials and 
access control. 
Permission Sets: You can create granular permission sets that align with the principle of least 
privilege, ensuring that each team has only the access they need. 
Group Assignments: By assigning teams to groups with specific permission sets, you streamline 
access management and reduce the complexity of individual user permissions. 
This approach minimizes operational overhead while maintaining secure and compliant access to 
sensitive customer data.

Application Load Balancer, an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances for web servers, and 
an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance that runs with the Single-AZ configuration. 
 
The website is slow to respond during searches of the product catalog. The product catalog is a 
group of tables in the MySQL database that the company does not update frequently. A solutions 
architect has determined that the CPU utilization on the DB instance is high when product catalog 
searches occur.
