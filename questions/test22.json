DAX is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB. It significantly improves read performance by caching frequently accessed data, reducing the load on DynamoDB and lowering latency. Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches static content like images from S3 at edge locations globally. This reduces latency for users accessing the static content and offloads traffic from the S3 bucket. Since 90% of read requests are for commonly accessed data, both DAX and CloudFront will provide substantial performance improvements.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nenabling ElastiCache Redis for DynamoDB and Amazon CloudFront for S3, is less efficient than using DAX. While ElastiCache Redis can be used as a cache, DAX is specifically designed for DynamoDB and offers tighter integration and easier management. DAX also handles invalidation and consistency automatically, which would need to be manually managed with ElastiCache Redis. CloudFront for S3 is a good choice for caching static content.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nenabling Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for DynamoDB and ElastiCache Memcached for S3, is not ideal. DAX is a good choice for DynamoDB caching. However, ElastiCache Memcached is not the best choice for caching static content in S3.

While ElastiCache Redis can be used as a cache for DynamoDB, DAX is a better-suited and more tightly integrated solution.

    "explanation": "**Why option 2 is correct:**\nThis is the best solution because it utilizes AWS Directory Service AD Connector and AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO). AD Connector allows AWS to connect to the on-premises Active Directory without replicating the directory in AWS, reducing operational overhead. IAM Identity Center provides centralized management of access to multiple AWS accounts within an AWS Organization. Permission sets in IAM Identity Center can be assigned based on Active Directory group membership, simplifying access control and ensuring compliance. This approach minimizes ongoing operational management by leveraging managed AWS services for identity federation and access control.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while it establishes a trust relationship between AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory and the on-premises AD, it requires deploying and managing a full-fledged Active Directory in AWS. This increases operational overhead compared to AD Connector. Also, managing IAM roles linked to AD groups directly can become complex across multiple accounts.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because manually creating IAM roles in each member account and instructing developers to assume roles is a highly manual and error-prone process. It doesn't provide centralized management or easy integration with the existing Active Directory. It also increases the operational burden and makes it difficult to maintain consistent access control policies across accounts. Control Tower helps with account provisioning but doesn't solve the identity management problem directly.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

AWS WAF allows you to create rules based on various criteria, including the originating country of the request. By attaching AWS WAF to the ALB, you can inspect incoming traffic and block requests originating from the two prohibited countries, while allowing traffic from the home country.

DataBrew recipes provide data lineage tracking, allowing users to audit and share transformation steps. Data profiling capabilities enable inspection of column statistics, null values, and data types.

It also doesn't inherently provide data profiling.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon AppFlow, is incorrect because AppFlow is primarily designed for transferring data between SaaS applications and AWS services. While AppFlow can perform some basic transformations during data transfer, it is not a comprehensive data preparation tool like DataBrew. It lacks the robust data profiling, data lineage, and visual workflow capabilities needed for the scenario.

    "explanation": "**Why option 3 is correct:**\nThese are correct because they represent fundamental security best practices for the AWS account root user. Creating a strong password (Option 1) makes it harder for unauthorized individuals to guess or crack the password. Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (Option 2) adds an extra layer of security, requiring a second authentication factor in addition to the password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if the password is compromised. AWS strongly recommends enabling MFA for the root user.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because storing access keys, even encrypted, on S3 is generally not recommended for the root user. The root user should be used sparingly, and access keys should be avoided if possible. If access keys are absolutely necessary, they should be managed with extreme care and rotated regularly.

Permissions boundaries allow you to set the maximum permissions that an IAM principal (user or role) can have. By attaching a permissions boundary to the developer's IAM role, you can restrict the maximum permissions they can grant to other IAM principals or use themselves, even if their IAM policy grants them more.

After termination, it will launch a new instance to maintain the desired capacity. Option 2 is also correct. Because of the manual termination of instances in AZ A, the ASG will detect an imbalance across Availability Zones. Auto Scaling's rebalancing feature will launch new instances in the under-represented AZ (AZ A) *before* terminating instances in the over-represented AZ (AZ B). This ensures that application performance and availability are not compromised during the rebalancing process. Launching before terminating is the default and preferred behavior.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because Auto Scaling launches new instances *before* terminating old ones during rebalancing to avoid capacity dips and maintain application availability.

This allows the company to train Comprehend to identify ingredient names specifically, without requiring deep ML expertise. S3 Event Notifications trigger a Lambda function upon file upload, which then uses Comprehend to extract the ingredient names. These names are then stored in DynamoDB, enabling the front-end application to query for health scores. This approach is cost-effective because Comprehend is a managed service, minimizing operational overhead. Lambda is also cost-effective due to its pay-per-use model. The solution is fully automated and can handle invalid submissions by simply not finding any ingredient names, thus not querying DynamoDB.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because Amazon Lookout for Vision is designed for image analysis, not text analysis.

SQS FIFO queues guarantee that messages are processed in the exact order they are sent. While FIFO queues have a lower throughput limit than standard queues, batching allows for increased throughput. Each batch counts as a single transaction towards the SQS limits. With a batch size of 4, the system only needs to perform 250 operations per second (1000 messages / 4 messages per batch = 250 operations), which is well within the SQS FIFO queue limits. This approach balances the need for ordered processing with the required throughput.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue to process the messages without batching, is incorrect because it might not be able to handle the peak rate of 1000 messages per second. While FIFO queues guarantee order, processing each message individually would likely exceed the default throughput limits of SQS FIFO queues, potentially leading to message throttling and performance issues. Without batching, the system would need to perform 1000 operations per second, which is significantly higher than the batched approach.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue in batch mode of 2 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate, is incorrect because it requires 500 operations per second (1000 messages / 2 messages per batch = 500 operations). While this is still within SQS FIFO limits, a batch size of 4 (Option 0) is more efficient as it reduces the number of operations required to achieve the desired throughput, leading to lower costs and potentially better performance.",

Multipart upload allows breaking the file into smaller parts, which can be uploaded in parallel, improving throughput and resilience. S3TA uses Amazon's globally distributed edge locations to optimize the network path between the on-premises data center and the S3 bucket, reducing latency and improving transfer speeds, especially over long distances.

    "explanation": "**Why option 3 is correct:**\nis the most suitable solution. Deploying an AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway on premises allows the company to present an NFS-compatible file share to their workloads. The File Gateway stores the uploaded files in Amazon S3, which provides virtually unlimited scalability and durability. S3 Lifecycle policies can then be used to automatically transition infrequently accessed objects to lower-cost storage classes like S3 Standard-IA or S3 Glacier, fulfilling the automated tiering requirement. This solution minimizes costs by leveraging S3's storage classes and allows the company to continue using their existing NFS-based tools and protocols, minimizing application changes. The File Gateway acts as a bridge between the on-premises NFS clients and the cloud-based S3 storage.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while Amazon EFS provides NFS compatibility and lifecycle management, it's generally more expensive than using S3 for large-scale data storage, especially when considering infrequently accessed data. EFS One Zone-IA is cheaper than standard EFS, but S3 with lifecycle policies to Glacier or Deep Archive will be more cost-effective for long-term archival of infrequently accessed data. Also, migrating all data to EFS upfront might not be the most cost-effective approach if a significant portion of the data is rarely accessed.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because using a Storage Gateway Volume Gateway in cached mode and attaching it as a block device to an on-premises file server adds unnecessary complexity and overhead. It requires maintaining an on-premises file server, which defeats the purpose of migrating to a cloud-based solution to address scalability issues. While snapshots can be stored in S3 Glacier Deep Archive, this approach is not as cost-effective or efficient as directly storing files in S3 and using S3 Lifecycle policies for tiering. Also, managing recovery operations and tiering with AWS Backup is not the most efficient way to handle archival and tiering in this scenario. The primary goal is to move away from on-premises infrastructure, which this solution doesn't fully achieve.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

Lambda functions are triggered by SQS messages and process the data in batches before writing it to the auto-scaled DynamoDB table. This solution requires no manual provisioning or scaling of compute resources, fulfilling the question's requirements. Lambda's ability to scale automatically based on the number of messages in the SQS queue ensures that the system can handle varying volumes of sensor data without manual intervention.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while Kinesis Data Firehose can directly write to DynamoDB, it's primarily designed for streaming data to data lakes or analytics services. While it can scale, it might not be the most cost-effective or flexible solution for this specific use case compared to Lambda and SQS. Also, Kinesis Data Firehose might not handle the specific data transformation requirements as efficiently as Lambda.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because it involves using an Amazon EC2 instance to poll the SQS queue. This introduces the need to manage and scale the EC2 instance, which contradicts the requirement for a fully serverless solution. EC2 instances require manual provisioning and scaling, which the development team wants to avoid. While DynamoDB is auto-scaled, the EC2 instance becomes a bottleneck and a point of operational overhead.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because it uses Kinesis Data Streams with an EC2 instance. Similar to option 1, using an EC2 instance to poll Kinesis Data Streams violates the serverless requirement. Kinesis Data Streams is a good choice for real-time streaming data, but requires a consumer application to process the data, and using EC2 for this purpose negates the serverless aspect. Furthermore, Kinesis Data Streams requires more configuration and management than SQS for this specific use case.",

This is crucial for ensuring that permit requests are processed in the correct sequence and that no request is lost or processed multiple times. The FIFO queue acts as a buffer between the web application and the processing tier, decoupling them and allowing the processing tier to handle requests at its own pace, even during periods of high traffic. This ensures reliability and scalability.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while API Gateway and Lambda can handle web requests, they don't inherently guarantee exactly-once processing. Lambda functions can be invoked multiple times in case of errors or retries, potentially leading to duplicate processing. While mechanisms can be implemented to mitigate this, it adds complexity and doesn't provide the built-in guarantee of exactly-once processing that SQS FIFO offers. Also, directly invoking Lambda from API Gateway for every form submission might not be the most cost-effective or scalable solution for high traffic.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because Amazon SQS standard queues do not guarantee exactly-once processing or message order.

Deploy EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to retry transactions as needed.** RDS Proxy helps manage database connections, reducing the overhead on the Aurora database. It pools and reuses database connections, preventing connection exhaustion during peak loads. Deploying EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group ensures that the application can scale horizontally to handle increased traffic. Retrying transactions handles transient failures effectively. This combination addresses scalability and resilience without requiring database changes.\n\n*   **Option 3: Modify the application to publish purchase events to an Amazon SQS queue. Launch an Auto Scaling group of EC2 workers that poll the queue and process purchases asynchronously.** This implements an asynchronous processing pattern. Instead of directly processing purchases synchronously, the application publishes purchase events to an SQS queue. An Auto Scaling group of EC2 workers then consumes these events and processes the purchases in the background. This decouples the front-end application from the back-end processing, allowing the front-end to remain responsive even during peak loads. SQS provides buffering and ensures that no purchase events are lost. The Auto Scaling group scales the processing capacity based on the queue length, providing scalability and cost-efficiency.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nOption 1: Deploy read replicas for the Aurora database in another Region and configure EC2 instances to read and write from the nearest replica based on latency. This option focuses on improving read performance and disaster recovery, but the problem is with write performance and application server scalability during peak purchase times. Read replicas do not help with write operations, which are the bottleneck in this scenario. Writing to a replica in another region would introduce significant latency and potential data consistency issues.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

The primary database synchronously replicates data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ) within the same region. Read Replicas, on the other hand, use asynchronous replication. This means that changes made to the primary database are replicated to the Read Replica with a slight delay. Read Replicas can be created within the same AZ as the primary, in a different AZ (Cross-AZ), or even in a different AWS Region (Cross-Region). This flexibility allows for scaling read operations and disaster recovery.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because it states that Multi-AZ follows asynchronous replication.

AWS Glue provides a serverless ETL service to transform and clean the data in S3.

    "explanation": "**Why option 2 is correct:**\nThis is the correct answer because it utilizes Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints and forwarding rules. An outbound endpoint allows DNS queries originating from the VPC to be forwarded to on-premises DNS servers. The forwarding rule specifies which domain names (e.g., *.internal.example.com) should be routed to the on-premises DNS servers. This approach is secure because it only forwards specific queries to the on-premises DNS servers, rather than exposing the entire VPC's DNS resolution to the on-premises environment. Associating the rule with the VPC ensures that only resources within that VPC can use the rule.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because using a Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint would allow on-premises systems to resolve DNS records within the VPC, which is the opposite of what the question requires. The application in AWS needs to resolve on-premises DNS records, not the other way around. Enabling recursive DNS resolution in the VPC is not sufficient on its own to resolve on-premises records.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because there is no AWS service called 'hybrid connectivity gateway'. This option is misleading. Furthermore, Route 53 does not directly attach to on-premises DNS servers as authoritative zones for internal domains in this manner. While Route 53 can *be* an authoritative DNS server, this option does not address the requirement of forwarding queries to existing on-premises DNS servers.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 3 is correct:**\nOptions 2 and 3 are the correct answers because they directly address the need to minimize application refactoring while migrating from SQL Server to Aurora PostgreSQL.\n\n*   **Option 2: Use AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) along with AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate the schema and data:** AWS SCT helps convert the database schema from SQL Server to PostgreSQL. It identifies potential compatibility issues and provides recommendations for resolving them. AWS DMS then migrates the data from the source SQL Server database to the target Aurora PostgreSQL database. This combination ensures that the database structure and data are migrated effectively.\n*   **Option 3: Deploy Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL to enable support for T-SQL commands:** Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL is a translation layer that allows Aurora PostgreSQL to understand and execute T-SQL commands. This is crucial because the existing applications are tightly integrated with T-SQL. By deploying Babelfish, the company can minimize the need to rewrite T-SQL queries in the applications, significantly reducing application refactoring effort. Babelfish translates the T-SQL commands into PostgreSQL-compatible SQL, allowing the applications to continue functioning with minimal changes.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while custom endpoints can be configured in Aurora, they cannot emulate the behavior of Microsoft SQL Server to the extent required for T-SQL compatibility. Custom endpoints are primarily for routing connections based on read/write workloads or other criteria, not for translating database dialects.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because using AWS Glue to convert T-SQL queries to PostgreSQL-compatible SQL during migration is not a practical solution for minimizing application refactoring. AWS Glue is primarily used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and data integration. It's not designed for real-time or on-the-fly query translation. Furthermore, modifying queries within Glue would require significant changes to the application logic and deployment pipelines, which contradicts the requirement to minimize refactoring.

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nOptions 0 and 4 are correct.\n\n*   **Option 0: Use VPC security groups to control the network traffic to and from your file system:** Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your EC2 instances and EFS mount targets. By configuring security group rules, you can allow only specific EC2 instances (or security groups representing those instances) to access the EFS mount targets on the required ports (typically NFS port 2049). This provides network-level access control.\n*   **Option 4: Use an IAM policy to control access for clients who can mount your file system with the required permissions:** IAM policies can be attached to IAM roles assumed by EC2 instances. These policies can grant or deny permissions to perform specific EFS actions, such as mounting the file system. By using IAM policies, you can control which EC2 instances are authorized to mount the EFS file system. This provides identity-based access control.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nOption 2: Set up the IAM policy root credentials to control and configure the clients accessing the Amazon EFS file system: Using root account credentials directly is a major security risk and a violation of AWS best practices. Root credentials should never be used for day-to-day operations or application access. IAM roles should be used instead.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nOption 3: Use network access control list (network ACL) to control the network traffic to and from your Amazon EC2 instance: While Network ACLs can control network traffic, they operate at the subnet level and are stateless. Security Groups are a better choice for controlling access to EFS because they are stateful and operate at the instance/mount target level, providing more granular control. Also, the question is asking about controlling access *to the EFS file system*, not the EC2 instance.\n\n**Why option 4 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

Here's why:\n\n*   **IAM Roles:** IAM roles are designed for delegation of permissions. They don't have associated credentials like passwords or access keys. Instead, they are assumed by trusted entities (in this case, users from the development account).\n*   **Cross-Account Access:** To enable cross-account access, you create an IAM role in the production account that trusts the development account. This trust is established through a trust policy that specifies the AWS account ID of the development account as the principal.\n*   **Granting Permissions:** The IAM role in the production account is granted the necessary permissions to access the required resources. This is done through an IAM policy attached to the role.\n*   **Assuming the Role:** Users in the development account can then assume this role using the AWS CLI, SDK, or Management Console. When they assume the role, they receive temporary security credentials that allow them to access the resources in the production account.\n\nThis approach is secure because it avoids sharing long-term credentials and provides temporary, least-privilege access.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because cross-account access is a fundamental feature of AWS IAM. It is possible and commonly used to grant access to resources in different AWS accounts.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while IAM roles are designed for delegation and can be assumed, IAM users represent individual identities. IAM users are not typically used directly for cross-account access in this manner. Sharing user credentials is a major security risk. Roles are the preferred method for cross-account access.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because sharing IAM user credentials is a severe security risk. It violates the principle of least privilege and makes auditing and access control difficult. If the shared credentials are compromised, the entire production environment could be at risk. This is a highly discouraged practice.\n\n**Why option 4 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

Instance store provides very high random I/O performance because the storage is physically attached to the host server. Since the application handles data replication and ensures data availability even if an instance fails, the ephemeral nature of instance store is acceptable. This avoids the cost overhead of persistent block storage like EBS or network file systems like EFS.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) based EC2 instances, is incorrect because EBS adds cost and complexity compared to instance store. While EBS can provide good performance, it's not as cost-effective as instance store when the application handles data replication and instance failure scenarios. The persistence offered by EBS is not necessary given the application's resilience.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon EC2 instances with access to Amazon S3 based storage, is incorrect because S3 is object storage, not block storage, and is not designed for high random I/O performance.

IRSA allows you to associate an IAM role with a Kubernetes service account.

While other storage classes might seem cheaper at first glance, the frequent access pattern within the 24-hour window makes S3 Standard the better option. S3 Standard is designed for frequently accessed data. The cost of retrieving data from S3 Standard is lower than retrieving data from Infrequent Access storage classes. Given the heavy referencing of the intermediary results, the retrieval costs from IA storage classes would quickly outweigh the slightly higher storage cost of S3 Standard over a 24-hour period. Furthermore, the simplicity of using S3 Standard avoids the added complexity and potential costs associated with data lifecycle management policies needed for other storage classes.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nstoring the data in Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA), is incorrect because S3 Standard-IA is designed for data that is accessed less frequently. While the storage cost is lower than S3 Standard, the retrieval costs are significantly higher. Since the intermediary query results are heavily referenced within the 24-hour period, the retrieval costs from S3 Standard-IA would likely exceed the cost savings from the lower storage cost, making it less cost-effective.

This approach is cost-effective and efficient for monitoring specific events within CloudTrail logs.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while Kinesis can handle streaming data, it adds unnecessary complexity and cost compared to using CloudWatch metric filters directly on CloudTrail logs. Kinesis is better suited for high-volume, real-time data processing, which is not explicitly required in this scenario. The latency introduced by Kinesis and Lambda might also be higher than using CloudWatch metric filters and alarms directly.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because Athena and QuickSight are primarily for historical analysis and reporting, not near-real-time alerting. Running Athena queries against CloudTrail logs and generating reports is a batch-oriented process that is not suitable for immediate detection of illegal API calls. It's more appropriate for post-incident analysis or trend identification.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because Trusted Advisor focuses on best practices and service limits, not on detecting illegal API calls.

Furthermore, it allows for fast regional failover, typically within seconds, by automatically redirecting traffic to a healthy region if one becomes unavailable.

While Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB) support UDP, they do not inherently provide the global reach and fast failover capabilities required by the question. ELB requires integration with Route 53 for global distribution, which adds complexity and might not be as fast as Global Accelerator's failover mechanism.

Amazon DynamoDB is a highly available and scalable NoSQL database, suitable for storing the processed updates. The combination of these services addresses all requirements: order, scalability, high availability, and minimal management.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because Amazon SNS is a publish/subscribe messaging service that does not guarantee message order. While Lambda can process the updates, SNS is not the right choice for ordered processing. Also, running a SQL database on an EC2 instance increases management overhead compared to a managed database service like DynamoDB or RDS.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while Kinesis Data Streams provides ordered processing, using a fleet of EC2 instances with Auto Scaling to process the data increases management overhead. Lambda is a more suitable serverless option. While DynamoDB is a good choice for the database, the EC2 instance processing is not optimal for minimizing management overhead.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because Amazon SQS is a message queuing service that does not guarantee message order unless using FIFO queues, which are not mentioned in the option. Also, processing messages from SQS using EC2 instances increases management overhead. While RDS MySQL is a viable database option, DynamoDB is generally preferred for high scalability and availability in this type of scenario, and the EC2 processing is a negative.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nThis is the correct answer because it utilizes a combination of services that provide a fully managed, scalable, and cost-effective solution. Amazon API Gateway provides a secure and scalable endpoint for receiving transaction requests. AWS Lambda handles the lightweight validation step without requiring server management. Amazon ECS with the Fargate launch type is used for the compute- and memory-intensive backend processing. Fargate eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances, allowing ECS to automatically provision and scale compute resources based on demand. This approach minimizes operational overhead and aligns with the requirement for a fully managed solution.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because Amazon SQS is primarily a message queuing service, not an API endpoint for receiving requests directly from mobile devices. While SQS can be used in conjunction with other services, it doesn't inherently provide the secure endpoint and request handling capabilities of API Gateway. Amazon EventBridge is more suited for event-driven architectures and less ideal for direct request validation. Amazon Lightsail instances, while simple to use, require more management than Fargate and may not scale as efficiently for compute-intensive workloads. The dynamic scaling policies based on memory thresholds and instance health checks are also more complex to configure and maintain compared to Fargate's automatic scaling.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 3 is correct:**\nThis is correct because it utilizes a scheduled action within the Auto Scaling Group. A scheduled action allows you to set the desired capacity of the ASG to 10 at the designated hour on the last day of each month. This ensures that the ASG scales out to the required number of instances *before* the peak traffic arrives, preventing performance lag. Setting the 'desired capacity' directly tells the ASG how many instances it should be running. The ASG will handle launching the necessary instances to meet this desired capacity.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because setting both the min and max count to 10 doesn't guarantee that the ASG will scale *before* the peak. It only ensures that the ASG can have a minimum and maximum of 10 instances. The initial capacity might still be 2, and the scaling event might happen *during* the peak, not before. The desired capacity is what triggers the scaling action.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nOptions 2 and 3 are incorrect because simple and target tracking scaling policies are designed to respond to changes in metrics (like CPU utilization or network traffic) in real-time. They are not suitable for predictable, scheduled scaling events. While they *could* eventually scale to 10 instances if the load increases, they won't proactively scale *before* the peak, leading to the same performance lag problem.

When data is uploaded to an edge location, it is then transferred to the S3 bucket over the AWS backbone network, which is generally faster and more reliable than the public internet. This reduces latency and improves upload speeds, especially for geographically distant locations. It's designed specifically for this type of scenario and is generally cost-effective for large file transfers.\n\n*   **Option 3: Use multipart uploads for faster file uploads into the destination Amazon S3 bucket:** Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part can be uploaded independently, and in parallel. This can significantly improve upload speed, especially over unreliable networks, as individual parts can be retried without re-uploading the entire file. It also allows for uploading large files that exceed the single object size limit. It is a built-in S3 feature and doesn't incur additional costs beyond standard S3 storage and request charges. It also improves resilience to network interruptions.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nOption 0: Use AWS Global Accelerator for faster file uploads into the destination Amazon S3 bucket. While Global Accelerator can improve network performance, it's generally more expensive than S3 Transfer Acceleration for S3 uploads.
