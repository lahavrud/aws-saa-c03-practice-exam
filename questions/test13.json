    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThis statement is not true because while frequent snapshots do provide a higher level of data durability, they *can* degrade the performance of your EBS volumes, especially if taken during peak usage times. Snapshots create a point-in-time copy of the volume, and the process of creating this copy can consume I/O resources, leading to a temporary performance reduction. Therefore, the statement that snapshots *will not* degrade performance is incorrect.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis statement is incorrect because General Purpose (SSD) and Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes have a throughput limit that can be higher than 128 MiB/s, depending on the volume size and type. gp2 volumes have a maximum throughput of 250 MiB/s, gp3 volumes can reach 1000 MiB/s, and io1/io2 volumes can also reach higher throughput limits. Therefore, the statement that they are limited to 128 MiB/s is not true for all cases.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis statement is incorrect because there is indeed a relationship between the maximum performance of your EBS volumes, the amount of provisioned IOPS (for io1/io2 volumes), and the instance type you are using. The instance type needs to be able to support the bandwidth and IOPS that the EBS volume is capable of delivering. If the instance type is a bottleneck, the EBS volume's performance will be limited. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis statement is incorrect because it accurately describes the 'first-touch' penalty. When you first access a block of data on a newly created or restored EBS volume, there can be a performance reduction (5-50%) as the block is retrieved from storage and loaded into the volume's cache. This is known as the 'first-touch' penalty or 'initialization tax'. Therefore, the statement is true.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThis is the most suitable solution because Amazon S3 provides scalable and cost-effective storage for large files. S3 Transfer Acceleration utilizes the globally distributed AWS edge locations to accelerate uploads to S3. By routing uploads through these edge locations, data is transferred over optimized network paths to the S3 bucket, reducing latency and improving upload speed, especially for users located far from the S3 bucket's region. This directly addresses the requirements of minimizing upload latency and maximizing performance for global users, while leveraging S3's cost-effectiveness for storage.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile Cache-Control headers can improve performance by caching static content, they do not address the core requirement of accelerating large file uploads. Cache-Control headers are primarily used for controlling how browsers and CDNs cache content, which is more relevant for static web assets than for user-generated data uploads. It doesn't help with the initial upload latency.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nUsing EC2 with Auto Scaling and CloudFront is a viable solution for hosting the application itself and caching static content. However, it doesn't directly address the requirement of optimizing large file uploads to the application. While CloudFront can cache downloads, the upload latency to the EC2 instances in a specific region would still be a bottleneck, especially for users far from that region. Furthermore, managing EC2 instances and Auto Scaling groups is more complex and potentially more expensive than using S3 with Transfer Acceleration for storing and uploading large files.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nAmazon ElastiCache is an in-memory data store that improves application performance by caching frequently accessed data. While it can enhance the application's responsiveness, it doesn't address the core requirement of minimizing latency for large file uploads and downloads. ElastiCache is not designed for storing gigabytes of user-generated data; it's better suited for caching database query results or session data.

Also, the question states the application currently uses a MySQL database, suggesting a relational data model. DynamoDB is not a direct replacement for a relational database without significant architectural changes. Provisioned capacity might improve performance, but it doesn't address the core issue of read contention on the primary database.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nUsing a compute-optimized EC2 instance for the database might provide some performance improvement, but it doesn't address the root cause of the problem, which is read contention.

The fact that the process cannot be interrupted aligns perfectly with the guaranteed availability of Scheduled Reserved Instances.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nReserved Instances are a good choice for long-term, consistent usage. However, they are not ideal for a short, recurring period like the first 7 days of each month. While they provide cost savings compared to On-Demand, the company would be paying for the instances for the entire term of the reservation (1 or 3 years), even when they are not being used. This makes them less cost-effective than Scheduled Reserved Instances for this specific use case.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nSpot Block Instances (now simply Spot Instances with defined duration) could offer significant cost savings, but they are not suitable for a process that cannot be interrupted.

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThis is the most straightforward and efficient solution. Creating a read replica allows the reporting queries to be executed against the replica, thus isolating the workload from the primary RDS instance that serves the web application. This minimizes the performance impact on the web application without requiring significant changes to the existing architecture or data migration. Read replicas are designed for read-heavy workloads and are relatively easy to set up and manage.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile a Multi-AZ database provides high availability and failover capabilities, it does not inherently offload read traffic. The standby instance in a Multi-AZ configuration is primarily for failover purposes and is not designed to handle read traffic directly. Directing reporting traffic to the standby instance is not a supported or recommended practice, and it could potentially interfere with the failover process. Furthermore, it doesn't address the need to separate the reporting workload from the primary database.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nCreating a cross-Region read replica would certainly offload the reporting workload. However, it introduces additional complexity and latency due to the geographical distance between the primary and replica. This adds unnecessary overhead and cost compared to a same-region read replica, especially since the question emphasizes minimizing effort. The added latency might also be unacceptable for the reporting requirements.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nCreating an Amazon Redshift database and migrating the reporting data to it would be a more complex and time-consuming solution. It involves significant data migration, schema changes, and potentially application code modifications to point the reporting queries to Redshift. While Redshift is well-suited for analytical workloads, it is overkill for this scenario, where a simple read replica can effectively address the performance bottleneck with minimal effort.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the requirement by creating a route within the VPC that allows traffic destined for S3 to be routed directly to S3 without traversing the internet. A gateway endpoint is designed specifically for S3 and DynamoDB, providing a cost-effective and highly available connection. It modifies the VPC route table to direct S3-bound traffic to the endpoint, ensuring no internet gateway or NAT gateway is required.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because an S3 interface endpoint uses AWS PrivateLink, which provides private connectivity to S3 using elastic network interfaces (ENIs) with private IP addresses in your VPC. While this does provide private connectivity, it's more complex and generally more expensive than a gateway endpoint for S3. The question doesn't necessitate the features of PrivateLink (like DNS resolution within the VPC), making the gateway endpoint the more appropriate and cost-effective solution.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because the location of the S3 bucket (private subnet or not) does not affect the network path taken by the EC2 instances to access S3. The EC2 instances still need a way to reach S3, and placing the bucket in a private subnet doesn't provide that connectivity. The bucket's accessibility is controlled by IAM policies and bucket policies, not the subnet it resides in (which it doesn't reside in anyway).\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because the Region of the S3 bucket, while important for latency and data residency, doesn't directly address the requirement of restricting internet-bound traffic. Even if the S3 bucket is in the same Region as the EC2 instances, the traffic will still attempt to go through the internet unless a VPC endpoint is configured.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 2 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the problem of instance initialization time. By configuring an Auto Scaling step scaling policy with an instance warmup condition, newly launched instances are given time to initialize before being considered healthy and receiving traffic. This prevents requests from being routed to instances that are still starting up, thus avoiding timeouts. The step scaling policy ensures that the Auto Scaling group can quickly add capacity in response to the traffic burst, while the instance warmup condition ensures that the new instances are ready to handle traffic before being put into service.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nA Network Load Balancer (NLB) with a slow start configuration is not the most effective solution for this scenario. While slow start gradually increases the traffic sent to new instances, it doesn't address the underlying issue of the 1-minute application initialization time. Instances will still be unavailable for the first minute, potentially causing timeouts during the traffic burst. NLB slow start is more suitable for gradual traffic increases, not sudden spikes with a known instance startup delay.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile ElastiCache can improve performance by caching frequently accessed data, it doesn't directly address the problem of instance initialization time. Offloading requests to ElastiCache might reduce the load on the application servers, but new instances will still take 1 minute to initialize, and users will still experience timeouts during that period. ElastiCache is more suitable for improving overall application performance and reducing database load, not for mitigating instance startup delays.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nCloudFront with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) as the origin can improve performance by caching static content and distributing traffic globally. However, it doesn't directly address the problem of the 1-minute application initialization time. While CloudFront can cache content, the initial requests to the ALB will still be subject to the instance startup delay, potentially causing timeouts for uncached content. CloudFront is more suitable for improving content delivery and reducing latency for geographically dispersed users, not for mitigating instance startup delays.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThis is the most cost-effective solution because Amazon CloudFront caches the website's content at edge locations globally. This reduces the amount of data transferred directly from the S3 bucket, significantly lowering outbound data transfer costs. CloudFront also offers compression and other optimizations that can further reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nMoving the website to Amazon EC2 with EBS volumes would likely increase costs. EC2 instances and EBS volumes have associated costs, and data transfer out from EC2 is generally more expensive than data transfer out from CloudFront when serving large amounts of static content. This option also adds operational overhead for managing the EC2 instances and EBS volumes.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nAWS Global Accelerator improves the performance of applications by routing traffic through AWS's global network. While it can improve performance, it primarily focuses on improving network latency and reliability, not on reducing data transfer costs. It doesn't cache content like CloudFront, so it won't significantly reduce the outbound traffic from S3. It also adds another layer of cost without directly addressing the primary cost driver.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nRearchitecting the website to run on API Gateway and Lambda would be a significant undertaking and is unlikely to be cost-effective for serving static website content. API Gateway and Lambda are better suited for dynamic content and serverless applications.

An Elastic IP address is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. By associating an Elastic IP address with an EC2 instance, and then configuring an A record in Route 53 to point to that Elastic IP, clients can whitelist the Elastic IP address. The EC2 instance acts as a proxy, forwarding traffic to the load balancer. This allows the clients to access the service through a known, static IP address, fulfilling the whitelisting requirement.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile a Network Load Balancer (NLB) provides static IP addresses per Availability Zone, it doesn't directly solve the whitelisting problem in a manageable way for a large number of clients. NLBs are designed for high performance and TCP/UDP traffic, and are not typically used for web traffic that requires HTTP/HTTPS inspection. Also, the question implies the need for a single, static IP address for clients to whitelist, not multiple per AZ. Furthermore, directly exposing the NLB's IP addresses to external clients for whitelisting is not a standard or recommended practice.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nAn Application Load Balancer (ALB) does not provide static IP addresses.

While it is the most cost-effective storage option, retrieving data from Glacier Deep Archive can take several hours, which does not meet the requirement for continuous data usage and high availability.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option offers lower availability than standard S3 because it stores data in a single Availability Zone. While it is more cost-effective than standard S3, it does not meet the requirement for high durability, as data loss is possible if the single Availability Zone becomes unavailable.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 2 is correct:**\nThis is correct because data transfer within the same Availability Zone is free. By placing all EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone, the application avoids incurring data transfer charges for the network traffic between the instances during the batch processing. This directly addresses the requirement of reducing overall data transfer costs.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nPlacing EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group primarily focuses on scaling the application based on demand or other metrics. While Auto Scaling can help optimize costs by adjusting the number of instances, it doesn't directly reduce the data transfer costs between instances. The data transfer costs will still be incurred regardless of whether the instances are part of an Auto Scaling group. Therefore, this option does not directly address the problem of minimizing data transfer costs.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nPlacing all EC2 instances in the same AWS Region reduces data transfer costs compared to transferring data between different Regions, which is significantly more expensive. However, data transfer between Availability Zones within the same Region still incurs charges. Therefore, while this option is better than using multiple Regions, it's not the most cost-effective solution for minimizing data transfer costs within the application's architecture.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nPlacing EC2 instances in private subnets in multiple Availability Zones increases data transfer costs. Data transfer between Availability Zones incurs charges. Using private subnets doesn't affect the data transfer costs; it only affects network accessibility from the public internet. This option is the opposite of what the question asks for, as it increases data transfer costs instead of reducing them.",

AWS KMS is a native AWS service designed for key management. Using CMKs allows the company's internal security specialists to create, manage, and rotate the encryption keys used for S3 and EBS encryption. This fulfills the security and compliance requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile AWS Secrets Manager can store secrets, including encryption keys, it's primarily designed for managing database credentials, API keys, and other secrets used by applications. It's not the primary service for managing encryption keys used to encrypt S3 buckets and EBS volumes. AWS KMS is the more appropriate service for this purpose.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nAWS CloudHSM provides dedicated hardware security modules within the AWS cloud. While it offers the highest level of security and control over cryptographic keys, it also introduces significant operational overhead and complexity. For the stated requirements of encrypting S3 and EBS with internally managed and rotated keys, AWS KMS provides a more suitable and less complex solution. CloudHSM is generally chosen when regulatory compliance mandates the use of dedicated hardware.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nAWS Systems Manager Parameter Store is designed for storing configuration data and secrets.

It provides a private connection between the VPC and S3, ensuring that traffic remains within the AWS network. This directly addresses the requirement of preventing internet access to the S3 bucket.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because enabling server access logging on the bucket only records access requests made to the bucket. It does not restrict or control access to the bucket itself. While logging is a good security practice, it doesn't address the core requirement of preventing internet access.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because while a bucket policy can restrict access, it needs to be used in conjunction with a VPC endpoint. A bucket policy alone cannot prevent access from the internet if there is no VPC endpoint in place. The question asks for a combination of actions, and using only a bucket policy is insufficient to meet the requirement.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because S3 ACLs (Access Control Lists) are a legacy access control mechanism and are not the recommended way to manage access to S3 buckets. Bucket policies offer more granular control and are the preferred method. Furthermore, ACLs alone cannot restrict access based on the source VPC.\n\n**Why option 4 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because restricting users using IAM policies controls what actions users can perform on the S3 bucket, but it does not prevent access from outside the VPC.

The NAT gateway allows instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet without allowing inbound traffic from the internet. Deploying a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone ensures high availability. This approach minimizes operational overhead because NAT Gateways are managed services, reducing the administrative burden compared to NAT instances.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nDeploying a NAT gateway in the private subnet would not provide the necessary internet access. NAT gateways need to be in a public subnet to route traffic to the internet gateway. The database servers are already in the private subnet, so placing the NAT gateway there doesn't solve the problem of outbound internet access.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nDeploying NAT instances requires more operational overhead than using NAT Gateways. NAT instances require manual configuration, patching, and scaling. While this solution would provide internet access, it doesn't meet the requirement of minimizing operational overhead.

This minimizes bandwidth costs because data is primarily accessed locally. Only changes are replicated to AWS for backup and disaster recovery. Immediate retrieval is possible because the data is stored locally, fulfilling the 'immediate retrieval' requirement. Stored volumes ensure the primary copy of the data resides on-premises, which is crucial for minimizing bandwidth costs when frequent access is needed.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because Amazon S3 Glacier Vault is designed for long-term archival storage and retrieval is not immediate. Expedited retrieval comes with additional costs, violating the 'no additional cost' requirement. Glacier is not suitable for frequent, immediate data access.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because AWS Storage Gateway using cached volumes stores only frequently accessed data locally. The remaining data resides in S3. While it can reduce latency for frequently accessed data, it doesn't guarantee immediate retrieval of all data without incurring bandwidth costs for retrieving data from S3. The question requires immediate retrieval of *all* data at no additional cost, which cached volumes cannot guarantee.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because AWS Direct Connect establishes a dedicated network connection between the on-premises data center and AWS.

Analyzing CloudTrail logs would require custom scripting and parsing, making it a more complex and less efficient solution than using AWS Config. It's also a reactive approach, requiring analysis after the policy has been attached, rather than proactively identifying violations.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nPublishing IAM user changes to Amazon SNS would require additional logic to process the messages and determine if a user has policies attached. This adds unnecessary complexity compared to using AWS Config, which is specifically designed for configuration compliance. SNS by itself doesn't provide the capability to evaluate compliance against a standard.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nRunning AWS Lambda when a user is modified could work, but it requires more development and maintenance overhead than using AWS Config.

Kubernetes is widely adopted and can be run on various cloud providers and on-premises, allowing the company to maintain the same configuration and administrator tools across different environments. EKS provides a managed Kubernetes service, reducing the operational overhead of managing the Kubernetes control plane.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nLaunching containers directly on Amazon EC2 instances, while possible, does not provide a managed container orchestration solution. It requires the company to manage the container lifecycle, scaling, and networking themselves, which increases operational overhead and does not directly address the requirement for consistent tooling across environments. It also doesn't inherently provide cloud agnosticism.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nAmazon ECS, while a managed container service, is AWS-specific and does not provide the cloud agnosticism required by the question. Using Fargate with ECS further ties the solution to AWS, making it difficult to migrate to other cloud providers or on-premises environments without significant changes. While ECS is a valid container orchestration service, it doesn't meet the cloud agnostic requirement.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nSimilar to option 2, Amazon ECS is an AWS-specific container orchestration service and does not provide the cloud agnosticism required.

It directly addresses the requirement of minimizing the impact of a DDoS attack on resources and improves the security posture.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile a custom Lambda function could potentially identify attacks, it would be more complex to implement and maintain than using AWS WAF's built-in rate-based rules.

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the performance bottleneck by caching the product catalog data. Since the product catalog is not frequently updated, caching it in ElastiCache for Redis will significantly reduce the load on the MySQL database during product catalog searches. Redis is an in-memory data store, offering very fast read performance, which will improve the website's responsiveness during searches. This directly addresses the high CPU utilization on the database instance.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nMigrating the product catalog to Amazon Redshift is not the best solution for this scenario. Redshift is designed for large-scale data warehousing and analytical workloads, not for serving real-time product catalog searches. While Redshift could handle the data, it would be overkill and likely more complex and expensive than necessary. The problem is high CPU utilization on the MySQL database due to frequent read operations, which is better solved with a caching solution.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nAdding more EC2 instances to the Auto Scaling group will not directly address the bottleneck, which is the high CPU utilization on the RDS instance. The web servers are likely waiting for data from the database, so scaling the web tier will not alleviate the database load. The bottleneck is at the data layer, not the application layer.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nTurning on Multi-AZ for the RDS instance improves availability and durability by providing a standby instance in a different Availability Zone. However, it does not directly address the performance issue of high CPU utilization during product catalog searches. Multi-AZ is primarily for disaster recovery and failover, not for improving read performance.

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nThis solution directly addresses the requirement of proactively increasing capacity. Scheduled actions allow you to define a schedule to automatically adjust the desired, minimum, and maximum capacity of the Auto Scaling group. By scheduling an action to increase capacity before the holiday traffic spike, the application can handle the increased load without performance degradation. This is the most effective way to handle predictable, recurring traffic patterns.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis approach relies on reactive scaling based on CPU utilization. While CPU utilization is a valid metric for scaling, it's not proactive. The Auto Scaling group will only scale up *after* the CPU utilization exceeds the defined threshold, which means there will be a period of time when the application is under stress and potentially experiencing performance issues. This contradicts the requirement to minimize performance impact.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nIncreasing the minimum and maximum number of EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group provides a higher baseline capacity, but it doesn't proactively scale *before* the expected traffic spike. It simply allows the Auto Scaling group to scale to a higher level if needed. It also potentially leads to unnecessary costs during periods of normal traffic, as you'll be running more instances than required. It doesn't address the proactive scaling requirement.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nSNS notifications are used for alerting and monitoring, not for scaling. While an SNS notification could be triggered by a CloudWatch alarm (e.g., high CPU utilization), it doesn't directly address the requirement of proactively increasing capacity.

Ordering 10 devices allows for parallel data transfer, reducing the overall migration time. Selecting an Amazon S3 bucket as the destination is correct because Snowball Edge directly integrates with S3. After the data is transferred to S3, a lifecycle policy can be configured to move the data to S3 Glacier for cost-effective long-term storage.

Transferring 750 TB over a 1 Mbps connection is impractical and would likely disrupt other network operations. This option does not meet the requirement of avoiding saturation of the internet connection.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile using Snowball Edge is a good approach for large data transfers, selecting an S3 Glacier vault directly as the destination during the Snowball Edge import process is not the standard or recommended approach.

Since it's fully managed, it significantly reduces operational overhead compared to setting up and managing a separate caching solution like ElastiCache. DAX is optimized for DynamoDB workloads, providing better performance than generic caching solutions in this specific scenario.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile ElastiCache for Redis can be used for caching, it requires more manual configuration and management than DAX.

Firehose automatically scales to handle the data volume and provides built-in error handling and retry mechanisms, ensuring high availability. The data can then be queried using services like Amazon Athena (for S3) or directly within Redshift or OpenSearch, enabling on-demand SQL-based analytics.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile Kinesis Data Streams can handle high-volume data ingestion, it requires additional processing and storage infrastructure to make the data available for analysis. It doesn't directly load data into a data store suitable for SQL queries. This would necessitate building and managing additional services like Kinesis Data Analytics or custom EC2-based processing to transform and load the data, increasing operational overhead.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nSimply placing the data in an S3 bucket addresses the storage requirement but doesn't provide a built-in mechanism for ingestion or on-demand analytics.

AWS Storage Gateway, specifically the File Gateway type, can be deployed on-premises and configured to present an SMB interface to the existing application. The File Gateway then asynchronously copies the files to Amazon S3 in AWS. This approach avoids the need to modify the application code, leverages the existing VPN connection, and allows the application to continue writing to the SMB share as before. The low-latency requirement is met because the application is still writing to a local SMB share, and the gateway handles the transfer to AWS in the background.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because Amazon EFS is a fully managed NFS file system service. While it's suitable for applications running in AWS, it's not designed to directly integrate with on-premises SMB file shares without significant application modifications.

Also, while FSx can be accessed from on-premises, it doesn't directly address the need to copy files from an existing on-premises SMB share without application changes.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because AWS Snowball is a physical device used for transferring large amounts of data to AWS. While it could be used to initially migrate the existing files, it's not a suitable solution for the ongoing daily transfer of hundreds of files. It would require manual intervention to ship the device back and forth, which is not practical for a daily process. It also doesn't address the low-latency requirement for the application.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThis is the correct solution because creating a read replica allows you to offload read-heavy reporting queries from the primary RDS instance. The read replica will handle the reporting workload, freeing up resources on the primary instance for order processing. This directly addresses the performance issues and prevents timeouts without restricting employees' ability to run reports.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nDistributing the ordering application across the primary and read replica is not a standard or recommended practice. Read replicas are primarily for read-only operations, such as reporting. Attempting to write to a read replica directly would lead to data inconsistencies and application errors. The primary database is designed to handle write operations, and the application should continue to use it for order processing.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nMigrating to DynamoDB might be a viable long-term solution, but it involves significant application changes and data migration. It doesn't directly address the immediate problem of timeouts caused by reporting queries on the RDS instance. Also, DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, and the question states that the application uses MySQL, which is a relational database. A complete migration to DynamoDB would require a significant rewrite of the application, which is not the most efficient solution for the stated problem.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nScheduling reporting queries for non-peak hours might reduce the frequency of timeouts, but it doesn't eliminate them entirely. It also restricts employees' ability to run reports whenever they need to, which violates the requirement of not preventing employees from performing queries. This is a workaround, not a proper solution.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 2 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the requirement by enabling point-in-time recovery (PITR). Automated backups, when enabled for an RDS instance, allow you to restore the database to any point in time within the specified retention period (up to 35 days). The question specifies a need to restore to a point 5 minutes before the data loss, which is achievable with automated backups and PITR. The automated backups create transaction logs that are used to replay transactions up to the desired point in time.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nRead replicas are primarily used for offloading read traffic from the primary database instance. While they can provide some level of data redundancy, they don't directly address the requirement of restoring the database to a specific point in time before data loss. Changes made on the primary instance are replicated to the read replica, so the data loss would also be replicated.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nManual snapshots allow you to create backups of your database at a specific point in time. However, they do not provide the granularity required to restore the database to a point 5 minutes before the data loss. Restoring from a manual snapshot would restore the database to the exact time the snapshot was taken, which may not be close enough to the desired recovery point. Furthermore, relying solely on manual snapshots requires proactive action before the data loss occurs, which is not a reliable recovery strategy.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

Amazon API Gateway can handle a large number of concurrent requests from the badge readers. It can then integrate with other AWS services like Lambda or Kinesis to process the messages and store the data for analysis. API Gateway handles authentication, authorization, and request validation, which are important for security. It also provides monitoring and logging capabilities, which are essential for operational visibility.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because launching a single EC2 instance introduces a single point of failure, which violates the high availability requirement. While you could implement high availability with EC2 instances behind a load balancer, it requires more manual configuration and management compared to using API Gateway. Also, managing the HTTPS endpoint, scaling, and security becomes the responsibility of the user, adding operational overhead.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because Route 53 is a DNS service and cannot directly receive HTTPS requests. Route 53 is used for routing traffic to different endpoints based on DNS records, but it doesn't act as an HTTP endpoint itself. While you could use Route 53 to direct traffic to an API Gateway endpoint, it doesn't fulfill the requirement of creating the HTTPS endpoint.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 allows resources within a VPC to access S3 without traversing the public internet.

The NAT gateway translates the private IP address of the EC2 instance to its own public IP address, allowing the EC2 instance to receive responses from the internet.

It doesn't, by itself, allow instances in private subnets to access the internet. To enable internet access for an instance in a private subnet using an internet gateway, you would need to associate a public IP address with the instance, which is not desirable in this scenario as it would expose the instance directly to the internet.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nPlacing a NAT instance in the same subnet as the EC2 instance would not provide the required outbound internet access.

RDS is a managed database service, which significantly reduces operational overhead because AWS handles tasks like patching, backups, and infrastructure management. Migrating to RDS for Oracle allows the company to continue using Oracle without significant code changes, as the application can connect to the RDS instance in a similar way it connected to the on-premises database. DMS facilitates the migration process itself, ensuring data is moved efficiently and reliably to the new RDS instance.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nUsing Amazon EC2 instances to migrate and operate the database servers would not reduce operational overhead. It would essentially be a lift-and-shift of the database to AWS, requiring the company to manage the operating system, database software, patching, backups, and other administrative tasks, similar to the on-premises environment. This defeats the purpose of reducing operational overhead.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incomplete. While DMS can migrate the database, it needs a target. Migrating to EC2 instances doesn't reduce operational overhead as the database still needs to be managed by the company.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nAWS Snowball Edge is primarily used for large-scale data transfers when network bandwidth is limited. While it can be used to move data to AWS, it doesn't address the operational overhead requirement. It only handles the initial data transfer.

Predictive scaling analyzes historical data to forecast future traffic patterns and proactively adjusts the Auto Scaling group's capacity. This allows the company to scale up before the business hours traffic surge and scale down afterward, minimizing idle resources and optimizing costs. It is more dynamic and responsive than scheduled scaling, which relies on fixed schedules and may not accurately reflect real-time demand fluctuations.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nScheduled scaling relies on predefined schedules and does not adapt to unexpected changes in traffic patterns. While it can address the general increase during business hours, it might not be flexible enough to handle variations in demand or unexpected spikes. This can lead to either over-provisioning (if the schedule is set too high) or under-provisioning (if the schedule is set too low). It doesn't dynamically adjust based on real-time metrics like CPU utilization.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nStep scaling policies react to current CPU utilization, adding or removing instances based on predefined thresholds. While this can help manage traffic, it's reactive rather than proactive. Adding a fixed number of instances (4 in this case) at a specific CPU utilization level might not be optimal for all scenarios. It could lead to over-provisioning if the demand increase is less than expected or under-provisioning if the demand increase is higher. It also doesn't address the need to scale down efficiently during off-peak hours. The question specifies avoiding over-provisioning, and this option doesn't guarantee that.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nSetting a desired capacity of 5 EC2 instances and disabling scaling policies would not address the fluctuating traffic patterns. It would likely lead to under-provisioning during peak hours, resulting in poor application performance and a negative user experience.

Placement groups offer low latency and high throughput network connectivity. Specifically, cluster placement groups are designed for applications that need tight inter-node communication and are ideal for minimizing latency and maximizing the network performance between instances. The requirement for the same instance type is a constraint of cluster placement groups, which are the best choice for low latency and high throughput.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile Dedicated Hosts provide dedicated hardware, they don't inherently guarantee low latency and high throughput between instances. Dedicated Hosts primarily address compliance and licensing requirements. The instances could still be placed far apart within the data center, negating the benefits of proximity. The cost is also significantly higher than using placement groups.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nWhile using multiple Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) and link aggregation can increase throughput, it doesn't inherently minimize latency. Link aggregation primarily focuses on increasing bandwidth, not reducing the time it takes for data to travel between instances. Placement groups are more effective for minimizing latency.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nAWS PrivateLink is designed for securely accessing AWS services or services hosted by other AWS accounts over the AWS network.

Launching two EC2 instances in different Availability Zones ensures that if one Availability Zone experiences a disruptive event, the application can failover to the instance in the other Availability Zone. Installing and configuring a database replication mechanism between the two instances allows for data synchronization. Implementing automatic failover mechanisms, such as using a floating IP address or a load balancer with health checks, ensures that the application automatically switches to the healthy instance in case of a failure. This setup provides both high availability and automatic failover.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis solution does not provide high availability. If the single EC2 instance fails, the application will experience downtime. Using an Elastic IP address allows you to remap the address to another instance but does not provide automatic failover. Manual intervention would be required to remap the Elastic IP, leading to downtime.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nWhile launching EC2 instances in different Regions provides disaster recovery capabilities, it does not directly address the requirement for automatic failover in the event of a disruptive event. Failover between Regions typically involves more complex configurations and longer recovery times compared to failover within the same Region across Availability Zones. The question specifically asks for automatic failover, which is more easily achieved within a single Region.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis solution suffers from the same problem as option 1.

API Gateway handles the validation of the user's identity token against the Cognito user pool. This eliminates the need for custom authorizers (Lambda functions) or manual API key management, significantly reducing operational overhead. It leverages the existing Cognito infrastructure, making it a fully managed and efficient solution.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile a Lambda authorizer can provide fine-grained control, it requires writing and maintaining custom code for authentication and authorization logic. This increases development effort and operational overhead compared to using a built-in Cognito authorizer, which is a managed service.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nCreating and assigning API keys for each user introduces significant operational overhead. It requires managing the API keys, distributing them to users, and handling key rotation and revocation. This approach is less scalable and more complex than using a Cognito user pool authorizer, which is a managed service.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nSending the user's email address in the header is not a secure or reliable method for authentication.

Using a Pinpoint journey allows for orchestrated messaging campaigns and tracking of user interactions. Configuring Pinpoint to send events to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream enables the capture of SMS responses and other relevant data. Kinesis Data Firehose can then be configured to deliver the data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage (one year as required) and subsequent analysis. This provides a complete solution for sending SMS, receiving replies, and storing the data for analysis.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nAmazon Connect is primarily designed for contact center solutions, not for general SMS marketing campaigns. While it can send SMS, it's not the most efficient or cost-effective solution for this scenario, especially considering the requirement for storing responses for analysis. The integration with Lambda to store responses would require custom coding and management, making it more complex than using Pinpoint.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nAmazon SQS is a message queuing service and is not directly used for sending SMS messages. It can be used as part of a larger system, but it doesn't provide the SMS sending functionality itself. The question specifically asks for a solution to send SMS messages, and SQS only handles message queuing. The SMS sending would need to be handled by another service, adding unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nAmazon SNS FIFO topics are designed for ordered message delivery and are not the most suitable option for sending SMS messages. While SNS can send SMS, it doesn't provide the same level of features and analytics as Amazon Pinpoint for marketing communications. Subscribing an Amazon SQS queue to the SNS topic would allow you to capture the SMS messages, but it doesn't address the requirement of receiving replies from users.

This directly addresses the reported issue of increasing delays as the company expands.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nDynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is an in-memory cache for DynamoDB. While it can improve read performance, the problem is not explicitly stated to be related to DynamoDB read performance. The bottleneck is in the processing of messages and sending invitations, not necessarily in retrieving meeting information from DynamoDB. Therefore, adding DAX might not significantly improve the overall performance of sending meeting invitations.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nAdding an API Gateway in front of the web application primarily addresses concerns related to API management, security, and request routing. While it can provide benefits like throttling and request validation, it doesn't directly address the bottleneck in the application that sends meeting invitations. The problem is not related to the web application accepting requests, but rather the processing of those requests and sending invitations.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nAmazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) used to cache and deliver static and dynamic content closer to users. It is primarily used to improve the performance of web applications by caching content at edge locations.

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThis is correct because security groups act as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic. Creating a security group rule that allows TCP port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0 (any IP address) will allow inbound HTTPS traffic to the web server. Since the question states the default security group is assigned, creating a new security group with the correct rule and assigning it to the EC2 instance will allow the traffic. The default security group is restrictive, so adding a new one with the correct rule is the best approach.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because security group rules define the source of inbound traffic and the destination of outbound traffic. Specifying 0.0.0.0/0 as the *destination* for port 443 would be relevant for *outbound* traffic, not inbound traffic to the web server. The requirement is to allow *inbound* traffic on port 443.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because while network ACLs control traffic at the subnet level, the question states that the default network ACL has been modified to block all traffic. While this option would allow inbound traffic on port 443, it doesn't address the outbound traffic requirement. Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that rules must be configured for both inbound and outbound traffic. Furthermore, the question asks for a *combination* of steps, implying that both a security group and network ACL configuration are needed. This option only addresses the network ACL.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because while updating the network ACL to allow both inbound and outbound traffic on port 443 is necessary due to its stateless nature, it doesn't address the security group configuration. The question asks for a *combination* of steps, implying that both a security group and network ACL configuration are needed.

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nThis is the most cost-effective option because AWS Lambda functions are billed based on actual usage (number of requests and execution duration). Since the API receives requests sporadically, Lambda functions will only incur costs when they are invoked. There are no costs when the function is idle. This aligns perfectly with the requirement of minimizing costs during periods of inactivity. Lambda also provides the low latency required for asynchronous processing within a few seconds.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nAWS Glue is designed for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations and data processing at scale. While Glue can be triggered by API Gateway, it's not optimized for low-latency, near real-time processing of individual requests. Glue jobs typically involve larger datasets and longer processing times, making them less suitable and more expensive for this scenario.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nAmazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service for running containerized applications. While EKS offers flexibility and scalability, it involves significant overhead in terms of infrastructure management and cost. Even when the API is idle, the EKS cluster will incur costs for the underlying EC2 instances or Fargate nodes. This makes it a less cost-effective option compared to Lambda for handling infrequent requests.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nAmazon ECS with EC2 requires managing EC2 instances, which incur costs even when the API is not receiving requests. While ECS with Fargate could be considered, it's still generally more expensive than Lambda for infrequent invocations due to the minimum resource allocation and associated costs, even when idle. Lambda's pay-per-use model makes it a better fit for the cost optimization requirement.",

Amazon S3 offers durable, scalable, and cost-effective object storage. S3's standard storage class is suitable for frequently accessed data, while S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive can be used for less frequently accessed data to further reduce costs after an initial period. S3 allows for concurrent access from multiple reporting tools, and its lifecycle policies can be used to automate the transition of logs to cheaper storage tiers after a certain period, optimizing cost.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis is not the most cost-effective solution for long-term storage of log files. EBS volumes are block storage devices primarily used for operating systems and application data that require high performance and low latency. While EBS can be used to store log files, it is more expensive than S3 for long-term archival, and managing EBS volumes across multiple instances can be complex. EBS is also tied to a specific Availability Zone, which can impact availability.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile this provides shared file storage accessible by multiple EC2 instances, it is generally more expensive than S3 for long-term archival of log files. EFS is designed for applications that require shared file system access and is suitable for frequently accessed data. For long-term storage of log files that are primarily accessed for analysis, S3 is a more cost-effective option, especially when leveraging S3's storage classes like Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is not a suitable solution for long-term storage or concurrent access. Instance store provides temporary block-level storage for EC2 instances. Data stored in instance store is lost when the instance is stopped, terminated, or fails. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement for 7-year retention. Also, instance store is not designed for concurrent access from multiple reporting tools.",

This allows the vendor's tool to temporarily assume the role in the company's account and perform the required actions without needing permanent credentials in the company's account. This approach adheres to the principle of least privilege and provides a secure way to grant access to external parties.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because creating an IAM user for the vendor in the company's account is less secure and harder to manage than using IAM roles for cross-account access. It requires managing credentials (passwords, access keys) for the vendor, which increases the risk of credential leakage and management overhead. It also violates the principle of least privilege, as the vendor would have permanent credentials in the company's account.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because adding the vendor's IAM user to an IAM group in the company's account does not establish a trust relationship between the two accounts. It would require the vendor's IAM user to have credentials in the company's account, which is less secure than using IAM roles for cross-account access.

Identity providers are typically used for federating access from external identity providers (e.g., SAML, OpenID Connect).

This approach doesn't minimize operational overhead as required.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because while SQS can decouple the data ingestion from the processing, it still requires EC2 instances to consume messages from the queue and process the data.
