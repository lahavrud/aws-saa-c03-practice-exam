These reports fetch a large amount of data and have complex queries with multiple joins, spanning across multiple business-critical core tables. CPU, memory, and storage metrics are around 50% of the total capacity. Can you recommend an improved and cost-effective way of generating the business reports while keeping the production application unaffected?",

They can be in the same or different regions and can be promoted to standalone databases if needed.\n\nThis solution ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery capabilities, which are key aspects of resilient architectures.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- Configure the Amazon RDS instance to be Multi-AZ DB instance, and connect the report generation tool to the DB instance in a different AZ: This option does not fully address the requirements, introduces unnecessary complexity, or is not the most appropriate solution for this scenario.\n- Migrate from General Purpose SSD to magnetic storage to enhance IOPS: This option does not fully address the requirements, introduces unnecessary complexity, or is not the most appropriate solution for this scenario.\n- Increase the size of Amazon RDS instance: This option does not fully address the requirements, introduces unnecessary complexity, or is not the most appropriate solution for this scenario.",
