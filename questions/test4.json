    "explanation": "**Why option 3 is correct:**\nThis is correct because it focuses on the ECS service's CPU utilization. The ECS service represents the running tasks (containers) that are serving the application. Monitoring the CPU utilization of the ECS service directly reflects the load on the application itself. When the service's CPU utilization rises above a threshold, it indicates that the existing tasks are becoming overloaded and that more tasks (containers) are needed to handle the increased traffic. Auto Scaling can then be configured to increase the desired count of tasks in the ECS service, effectively scaling out the application. This directly addresses the need for an automated solution to respond to traffic spikes and maintain availability.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while the Application Load Balancer's target group CPU utilization is a valid metric, it's an *indirect* indicator of the load on the ECS service. The target group CPU utilization reflects the CPU usage of the instances registered with the target group, which are the ECS container instances. Scaling based on the ECS service's CPU utilization is more precise and directly tied to the application's performance. The target group CPU utilization could be high due to other processes running on the container instances, not necessarily the ECS tasks. Also, scaling based on target group CPU utilization might not accurately reflect the load on individual tasks within the ECS service.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because it suggests scaling based on the CloudWatch alarm's CPU utilization. CloudWatch alarms are *triggered* by metrics, but they don't *have* CPU utilization themselves. The alarm is likely monitoring the CPU utilization of the ECS container instances, similar to option 0. Scaling based directly on the ECS service's CPU utilization is a more direct and effective approach. The CloudWatch alarm is just a notification mechanism, not the trigger for Auto Scaling.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

A Cached Volume stores the entire dataset on Amazon S3 and caches the most frequently accessed data locally. This directly addresses the requirement of having frequently accessed logs available locally for low latency while ensuring all logs are backed up in S3. The Storage Gateway handles the data transfer and caching automatically.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nusing AWS Direct Connect, is incorrect because Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection between the on-premises data center and AWS, but it doesn't provide a caching mechanism or automatic backup to S3. While Direct Connect can improve network performance, it doesn't solve the core problem of caching frequently accessed logs and backing up all logs.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nusing AWS Storage Gateway - Stored Volume, is incorrect because a Stored Volume stores the entire dataset locally and asynchronously backs it up to Amazon S3. This means the primary copy of the data resides on-premises, which is not ideal for the scenario where the requirement is to have all logs backed up to S3 and only frequently accessed logs cached locally. Stored Volumes are more suitable when the primary data storage is on-premises and S3 is used for backup or disaster recovery.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nusing AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized, is incorrect because while Snowball Edge can provide local storage and data transfer to S3, it's primarily designed for large-scale data migration or edge computing scenarios where network connectivity is limited or unavailable. It's not a suitable solution for continuous web log archival and caching, as it requires manual data transfer and doesn't provide automatic caching like Storage Gateway.",

It allows you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. AWS Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations. With AWS Config rules, you can define the desired configuration state of your resources and AWS Config automatically checks whether your resources comply with these rules. It also maintains a configuration history, allowing you to track changes over time and troubleshoot issues. This directly addresses both requirements of the question.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon CloudWatch, is incorrect. CloudWatch is primarily a monitoring service for metrics and logs.

EFS is a network file system that can be mounted to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously, making it ideal for sharing data between ECS tasks running on different instances. Provisioned Throughput mode allows you to specify the throughput your application requires, ensuring consistent performance even under high load. While EFS has a Bursting Throughput mode, the sustained high-frequency read/write requirements of hundreds of concurrent tasks would likely exhaust the burst credits quickly, leading to performance degradation. Provisioned Throughput guarantees the necessary performance for the application.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon EFS with Bursting Throughput mode, is incorrect because the workload involves high-frequency reading and writing from hundreds of tasks concurrently. The burst credits for EFS Bursting Throughput mode would likely be exhausted quickly, leading to significant performance degradation.

Furthermore, FSx for ONTAP is a fully managed service, minimizing operational overhead. The 'root volume' mention is a bit misleading, as you would configure the file system on the FSx for ONTAP instance, not specifically on the root volume in a traditional sense. The key is that FSx for ONTAP handles the underlying storage management.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon EFS with EFS Infrequent Access and AWS DataSync, is not the best solution. While EFS supports NFS and offers an Infrequent Access tier for cost optimization, it does *not* natively support SMB. Therefore, it cannot directly serve Windows clients using the SMB protocol. DataSync is a good tool for migrating data, but it doesn't address the protocol incompatibility.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon FSx for OpenZFS, is not the best solution. While FSx for OpenZFS is a powerful file system, it primarily supports NFS. While it can support SMB via configuration and integration, it is not its primary strength and adds complexity.

The endpoint policy allows you to control which S3 buckets can be accessed through the endpoint, enhancing security.

While it can identify potential vulnerabilities that *could* be exploited in a DDoS attack, it doesn't directly mitigate DDoS attacks. Patching vulnerabilities is important for overall security, but it's not a real-time DDoS mitigation strategy. It also doesn't provide the detailed logging needed for audit purposes.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\ndeploying Amazon GuardDuty, is incorrect because GuardDuty is a threat detection service that analyzes CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs to identify malicious activity. While GuardDuty can detect suspicious activity that *might* be related to a DDoS attack, it doesn't provide automatic DDoS mitigation. Manually blocking IP addresses based on GuardDuty findings is a reactive approach and would be difficult to scale and maintain during a large-scale DDoS attack.

Amazon S3 is a highly scalable, durable, and cost-effective object storage service, ideal for storing large video files. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (S3TA) leverages the globally distributed AWS edge locations to accelerate data transfers to and from S3. When a user uploads or downloads a file, the data is routed through the nearest edge location, which then uses optimized network paths to transfer the data to or from the S3 bucket. This significantly reduces latency for users in geographically dispersed locations, especially for large files. S3 provides the storage and S3TA provides the low latency global access.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while Amazon S3 is a good choice for storage, using Amazon EC2 for hosting the web application adds unnecessary operational overhead and cost compared to hosting a static website directly from S3. ElastiCache is primarily for caching frequently accessed data to improve application performance, but it doesn't directly address the latency issues associated with transferring large files across geographic regions. While ElastiCache can improve web application performance, it doesn't accelerate the transfer of large video files like S3 Transfer Acceleration does.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis partially correct.

    "explanation": "**Why option 2 is correct:**\nlaunching AWS Global Accelerator and creating endpoints for all the Regions, then registering the Application Load Balancers of each Region to the corresponding endpoints, is the correct solution. AWS Global Accelerator provides a static entry point (two static IP addresses) for applications deployed in multiple AWS Regions. This significantly reduces the number of IP addresses that need to be managed in the firewall. Global Accelerator intelligently routes traffic to the nearest healthy endpoint (ALB) based on user location and health checks. This simplifies traffic management and improves application availability and performance. It also provides DDoS protection by default.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nsetting up a Network Load Balancer (NLB) with an elastic IP address and registering the private IPs of all the Application Load Balancers as targets, is incorrect. While an NLB can provide a single entry point with a static IP, it would require the NLB to be in a single region. Routing traffic across regions would still require managing the NLB's IP address in the firewall, and it doesn't inherently simplify the management of the ALBs themselves. Also, using private IPs as targets for an NLB that is intended to be publicly accessible is not a standard or recommended practice.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nassigning an Elastic IP to an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and setting up multiple Amazon EC2 instances to run behind the Auto Scaling Groups for each of the Regions, is incorrect. This option completely bypasses the existing Application Load Balancers, which are already in place and presumably serving a purpose. It also introduces a new layer of complexity by requiring the company to manage EC2 instances and Auto Scaling Groups. This does not address the core problem of simplifying the management of the existing ALB infrastructure and reducing the number of IP addresses.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 3 is correct:**\nThis is correct because it leverages IAM roles and instance profiles. An IAM role is created with the necessary permissions to access the DynamoDB table. An instance profile is then used to associate this role with the EC2 instance. When the application running on the EC2 instance makes a request to DynamoDB, the AWS SDK automatically uses the credentials provided by the instance metadata service, which are derived from the assigned IAM role. This eliminates the need to store credentials directly on the instance or in the application code, enhancing security and simplifying credential management. The EC2 instance doesn't need to be explicitly added to the trust relationship policy document; the instance profile handles that implicitly.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because storing credentials in an S3 bucket, even if encrypted, and then retrieving them from the application code is a less secure and more complex approach than using IAM roles. It introduces the risk of the S3 bucket being compromised or the credentials being accidentally exposed.

This is the correct approach when the target is another domain name and not a specific AWS resource.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nAn A record maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. Since the application is hosted on yourapp.provider.com, we don't have a static IP address to point to directly.

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nusing Amazon CloudFront with Amazon S3, is the correct solution. Amazon S3 provides highly scalable and durable storage for static assets. CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN), caches these assets at edge locations globally, reducing latency for users and offloading traffic from the origin server (S3). This combination is cost-effective because S3 is pay-as-you-go for storage and data transfer, and CloudFront's pricing is based on usage. It avoids the need to provision and manage servers, fulfilling the question's requirements.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon CloudFront with Amazon DynamoDB, is incorrect. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database designed for high-performance, low-latency access to data, but it's not suitable for storing large static assets like leaderboard reports and game tactics. Storing these assets in DynamoDB would be significantly more expensive and less efficient than using S3. While CloudFront is a good choice for caching, DynamoDB is the wrong storage service for this scenario.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nconfiguring AWS Lambda with an Amazon RDS database, is incorrect. Lambda is a serverless compute service, but using it with RDS to serve static assets is an overly complex and expensive solution. RDS is a relational database service, designed for structured data, not for storing and serving static files. While Lambda can serve static content, it's not optimized for this purpose, and using RDS as the data source adds unnecessary overhead and cost. This approach also requires more configuration and management than using S3 and CloudFront.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nusing AWS Lambda with Amazon ElastiCache and Amazon RDS, is incorrect. This option is even more complex and costly than option 2. ElastiCache is an in-memory caching service, which could be useful for caching dynamic content, but it's not the primary solution for serving static assets.

EC2 instance recovery is a feature that automatically migrates the instance to a new host if there's an underlying hardware failure. This process typically takes a few minutes, fitting within the 10-minute downtime requirement. The stipulation that the instance should be configured with an EBS volume is crucial because instance recovery is only supported for EBS-backed instances. Instance store volumes are ephemeral and data is lost upon instance failure, making recovery impossible.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations and best practices, but it doesn't automatically remediate issues. While Trusted Advisor can identify unhealthy instances, it requires manual intervention to recover them, which doesn't meet the 'automatic recovery' requirement.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because EC2 instance recovery is only supported for EBS-backed instances. Instance store volumes are ephemeral and data is lost upon instance failure, making recovery impossible.

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nusing a target tracking scaling policy based on a custom Amazon SQS queue metric, is the most suitable solution. Target tracking scaling allows you to set a target value for a metric, such as the number of messages in the SQS queue (QueueLength). Auto Scaling then automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances to maintain that target value. This is ideal for handling fluctuating workloads because it continuously monitors the metric and makes adjustments as needed. It's more dynamic and responsive than simple or step scaling.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nusing a simple scaling policy based on a custom Amazon SQS queue metric, is less effective than target tracking. Simple scaling policies react to alarms based on metric thresholds. While they can scale up or down, they require a cool-down period after each scaling action, which can be problematic during rapid spikes. The cool-down period prevents the Auto Scaling group from reacting quickly enough to sustained high loads, potentially leading to continued performance issues.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nusing a step scaling policy based on a custom Amazon SQS queue metric, is also less ideal than target tracking. Step scaling allows you to define multiple scaling adjustments based on the severity of the alarm breach. While more flexible than simple scaling, it still requires defining specific thresholds and scaling adjustments, which can be challenging to optimize for varying load patterns. Target tracking is generally simpler to configure and more adaptive to changing conditions.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nusing a scheduled scaling policy based on a custom Amazon SQS queue metric, is not appropriate for handling sudden spikes. Scheduled scaling is based on predictable load patterns at specific times. It does not react to real-time changes in the SQS queue length caused by unexpected order surges.

    "explanation": "**Why option 2 is correct:**\nThis is correct because it leverages NAT Gateways deployed in the public subnets. NAT Gateways allow instances in the private subnets to initiate outbound traffic to the internet, while preventing the internet from initiating inbound connections to those instances. By placing a NAT Gateway in each public subnet (one per AZ), the solution achieves high availability. Each private subnet's route table is configured to route non-local traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT Gateway in the *same* Availability Zone. This ensures that if a NAT Gateway in one AZ fails, the instances in the corresponding private subnet can failover to another AZ. This approach adheres to best practices for security and high availability in VPC design.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because placing NAT Gateways in the *private* subnets defeats the purpose of having private subnets. NAT Gateways need to be in public subnets to have a public IP address and connect to the internet gateway. Furthermore, routing traffic from a private subnet to a NAT gateway in the same private subnet wouldn't work, as the NAT gateway needs to be in a public subnet to reach the internet gateway.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because Egress-Only Internet Gateways are designed for IPv6 traffic only. The question explicitly states that the VPC and subnets use IPv4 CIDR blocks. Therefore, an Egress-Only Internet Gateway is not the appropriate solution for providing internet access to the private subnets in this scenario. Also, an Egress-Only Internet Gateway only allows outbound traffic from the VPC, it does not provide NAT functionality for IPv4.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 2 is correct:**\nSetting up Amazon ElastiCache in front of the Amazon RDS database is the most suitable solution. ElastiCache is an in-memory data store service that can cache frequently accessed data, such as player scores and stats. By caching this data, the application can retrieve it from ElastiCache instead of the RDS database, significantly reducing the load on the database and improving read latency. This allows the company to downsize the RDS instance, as it will be handling fewer read requests. ElastiCache offers both Memcached and Redis engines. Memcached is suitable for simple caching scenarios, while Redis offers more advanced features like data persistence and more complex data structures. The choice depends on the specific requirements of the gaming application.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nMoving to Amazon Redshift is not the best solution for this scenario. Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse service designed for analytical workloads (OLAP), not for handling high-volume, low-latency read requests for individual player scores and stats (OLTP). While Redshift can handle large datasets, it's not optimized for the type of real-time data access required by the gaming application. It's also significantly more complex and expensive to set up and maintain for this specific use case.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nSwitching application code to AWS Lambda might improve the application's scalability and responsiveness in general, but it doesn't directly address the problem of high read traffic on the RDS database. Lambda functions still need to access the database to retrieve the player scores and stats. While Lambda can be used in conjunction with other solutions (like ElastiCache), it's not a standalone solution for reducing database load and latency in this scenario. Moreover, the question focuses on the database layer performance, not the application layer.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nusing Amazon SQS, is the correct solution. Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS allows the faster microservices to enqueue messages, which are then consumed by the slower microservices at their own pace. This asynchronous communication pattern prevents the faster services from being blocked or slowed down by the slower services, ensuring overall system resilience and performance. SQS provides features like message durability, scalability, and configurable message retention, making it suitable for handling varying processing speeds and ensuring reliable message delivery.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon SNS, is incorrect. Amazon SNS is a publish/subscribe messaging service primarily used for broadcasting messages to multiple subscribers. While it can decouple services, it's not the best choice for handling different processing speeds. SNS is more suitable for scenarios where multiple services need to be notified of an event simultaneously, not for queuing messages for asynchronous processing at different rates. SNS does not inherently provide message persistence or guaranteed delivery in the same way as SQS, making it less suitable for decoupling services with varying processing speeds where message reliability is crucial.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, is incorrect. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is designed for real-time streaming data ingestion and processing. While it can decouple services, it's primarily intended for high-throughput, continuous data streams, such as log data or clickstream data. It's not the ideal choice for general-purpose asynchronous communication between microservices with varying processing speeds. Kinesis Data Streams is more complex to set up and manage than SQS for this specific use case, and its focus on real-time data processing doesn't align with the requirement of decoupling services with different processing speeds.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nadding Amazon EventBridge, is incorrect. Amazon EventBridge is an event bus service that enables you to build event-driven applications. While it can decouple services by routing events between them, it's more suitable for complex event routing and filtering based on event patterns. For the specific requirement of decoupling microservices with different processing speeds, SQS provides a simpler and more direct solution for asynchronous message queuing. EventBridge adds complexity that isn't necessary for this scenario. EventBridge is better suited for orchestrating complex workflows and routing events based on specific conditions, rather than simply queuing messages for asynchronous processing.",

Alias records are a Route 53 specific record type that are used to map a domain name to an AWS resource, such as an Elastic Load Balancer, an Amazon S3 bucket configured as a static website, or another Route 53 record in the same hosted zone. They are preferable to CNAME records for the root domain because CNAME records cannot be used for the zone apex (the root domain). Alias records also offer health checking capabilities, which can improve the reliability of the application. While not explicitly mentioned in the question, alias records are generally more cost-effective than other solutions in scenarios where they are applicable, as they are tightly integrated with AWS services and can leverage existing infrastructure.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\ncreating an NS record for covid19survey.com that routes traffic to www.covid19survey.com, is incorrect. NS records define the name servers responsible for a domain. They are used for delegating a subdomain to a different set of name servers, not for redirecting traffic within the same domain. Using NS records for this purpose would be inappropriate and would likely break DNS resolution for the domain.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\ncreating a CNAME record for covid19survey.com that routes traffic to www.covid19survey.com, is incorrect.

While SSE-S3 doesn't use a different key *per file* in the strictest sense, it does encrypt each object with a unique key derived from the S3 managed key. This provides strong encryption at rest without the complexity of managing individual keys. S3 handles the key management and rotation, minimizing operational overhead. The question doesn't explicitly state that the keys must be completely independent; it focuses on encrypting each file differently for maximum security, which SSE-S3 achieves.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while Multi-Region keys and the S3 Encryption Client can be used for client-side encryption and generating unique keys, it introduces significant complexity and overhead. The company would need to manage the client-side encryption process, key generation, and key storage, which contradicts the requirement of minimizing overhead. Also, Multi-Region keys are primarily for disaster recovery, not for individual object encryption.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because storing logically divided data into different S3 buckets reintroduces the overhead of splitting the data, which the question explicitly aims to avoid. While SSE-S3 would encrypt each bucket's contents, it doesn't address the requirement of encrypting each *file* with a different key. It also adds operational complexity in managing multiple buckets.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while SSE-KMS allows for more control over encryption keys, using encryption context to generate a different key for each file/object is not the intended use case and is not directly supported by AWS. Encryption context is used for adding additional authenticated data to the encryption process, not for generating unique keys.

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nThis is correct because Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide high availability and durability for database instances. When you enable Multi-AZ, RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In case of a failure of the primary DB instance, RDS automatically fails over to the standby replica, minimizing downtime and data loss. Synchronous replication ensures that every transaction is written to both the primary and standby instances before the transaction is considered complete, thus meeting the requirement of storing every transaction on at least two nodes and minimizing data loss.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while read replicas can improve read performance, they are typically asynchronous. Asynchronous replication means that there can be a delay between when data is written to the primary instance and when it is replicated to the read replica. This delay can lead to data loss in the event of a primary instance failure. The question specifically requires minimal data loss and storage on at least two nodes, which necessitates synchronous replication.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because synchronous replication across AWS Regions is generally not supported by default with RDS MySQL. While cross-region read replicas exist, they are asynchronous. Synchronous replication across regions would introduce significant latency and complexity, making it impractical for most applications requiring minimal data loss. The question specifically asks for a solution that minimizes data loss, implying synchronous replication, which is best achieved within a single region using Multi-AZ.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because it involves a more complex and less managed solution. Setting up a MySQL DB engine on an EC2 instance and using a Lambda function to replicate data to an RDS instance introduces significant overhead and complexity. Furthermore, implementing synchronous replication using Lambda would be challenging and inefficient, potentially leading to data loss and performance issues.

This approach is cost-effective because it avoids Lambda invocations for authentication, and it minimizes latency because the validation is performed directly by API Gateway. The native JWT authorizer also supports scope-based access control by allowing you to map JWT claims (including scopes) to API Gateway permissions.

Second, WebSocket APIs are primarily designed for real-time, bidirectional communication, which is not the primary use case described in the question (securing backend APIs for web and mobile applications).

API Gateway is specifically designed for managing APIs, including features like authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and usage quotas. Usage plans in API Gateway allow you to define who can access one or more deployed API stages and methods. You can also configure throttling and quota limits that are enforced on individual API keys. API keys are distributed to clients, enabling per-client rate limiting and usage tracking. This directly addresses the requirements of preventing API abuse, protecting downstream resources, and ensuring fair usage across clients by allowing different limits to be applied to different API consumers.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) can inspect traffic, it's primarily for integrating with third-party virtual appliances like firewalls and intrusion detection systems. It's not the ideal solution for implementing per-client rate limiting and usage quotas. Implementing this with a GWLB would require significant custom configuration and integration with external systems, making it more complex and less efficient than using API Gateway.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because Application Load Balancers (ALBs) primarily focus on routing traffic to backend targets based on path, host, or other request attributes.

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThis is correct because migrating to Amazon Aurora MySQL and using Aurora Replicas significantly reduces replication lag. Aurora's architecture is designed for high performance and low latency replication. Aurora Replicas share the same underlying storage as the primary instance, eliminating the need for traditional asynchronous replication. This shared storage architecture allows for near real-time replication, often achieving replication lag of milliseconds. Aurora Auto Scaling further optimizes performance by automatically adjusting the number of Aurora Replicas based on workload demands, ensuring consistent performance during traffic spikes. This solution minimizes code changes as Aurora is largely MySQL-compatible, and it reduces management overhead due to Aurora's managed nature and Auto Scaling capabilities.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while using memory-optimized EC2 instances might improve the performance of the primary database and compute-optimized instances could handle read queries, it doesn't directly address the underlying cause of replication lag. Traditional MySQL replication is asynchronous, and the lag can be influenced by network latency, primary instance write load, and replica instance read load. Simply increasing the compute power of the instances doesn't guarantee a reduction in replication lag to the required 1-second threshold. It also increases management overhead compared to a managed service like Aurora.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because migrating to DynamoDB would require significant application code changes. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database with a different data model than MySQL, necessitating a complete rewrite of the database access layer. While DynamoDB is highly scalable and can handle high throughput, it's not a suitable solution when minimal code changes are desired. Also, the question specifies a relational database backend, which DynamoDB is not.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while ElastiCache for Redis can improve read performance by caching frequently accessed data, it doesn't directly address the replication lag issue. The read replicas would still fall behind during peak traffic, and the website would still query them when the data is not in the cache, leading to inconsistent results. This option adds complexity to the application by requiring it to check the cache before querying the database, and it doesn't guarantee that the data in the cache is always up-to-date.",

While FSx for Lustre is a high-performance file system, it is designed for compute-intensive workloads like machine learning, high-performance computing (HPC), and video processing. It is not primarily designed for Windows-based applications or integration with Active Directory. It is also not the best fit for general-purpose shared storage for Windows applications. The question emphasizes minimal integration effort, and FSx for Lustre would likely require more configuration and adaptation than FSx for Windows File Server.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), is incorrect.

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThe Internet Gateway (I1) performs the Network Address Translation (NAT) for the Amazon EC2 instance E1. When an EC2 instance is assigned a public IPv4 address, the Internet Gateway automatically performs a one-to-one NAT between the instance's public IP address and its private IP address. This allows the instance to communicate with the internet. The Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nRoute Table (R1) is incorrect because a route table contains rules (routes) that determine where network traffic is directed. It does not perform NAT. It simply directs traffic to the appropriate target, such as the Internet Gateway.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nSubnet (S1) is incorrect because a subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. It does not perform NAT. It's just a logical division of the VPC's IP address space.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nNetwork Address Translation (NAT) instance (N1) is incorrect because the EC2 instance E1 already has a public IP address. A NAT instance is used when you want instances in a *private* subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with the instances. Since E1 has a public IP, it doesn't need a NAT instance to connect to the internet.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nusing Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, is the most suitable solution. Kinesis Data Streams is designed for ingesting and processing high-volume, real-time data streams. It provides scalability and durability, and can be integrated with AWS Lambda for processing or Kinesis Data Analytics for running analytics directly on the stream. This addresses the need for a scalable, real-time data ingestion and analytics workflow with minimal implementation overhead, as Kinesis is a managed service.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon SNS, is not ideal for real-time data ingestion and analytics workflows. SNS is primarily a pub/sub messaging service for notifications. While it can trigger Lambda functions, it's not designed for high-throughput data streaming and lacks the data persistence and ordering guarantees of Kinesis. It also doesn't directly support analytics.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon SQS, is a message queuing service suitable for decoupling components and handling asynchronous tasks. While it provides reliability and scalability, it's not optimized for real-time data streams. SQS is better suited for batch processing or handling discrete events, not continuous data flows. Also, while it can trigger Lambda, it doesn't directly support analytics workflows like Kinesis Data Analytics.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon API Gateway, primarily focuses on managing and securing APIs. While it can handle increased traffic, it doesn't address the underlying issue of data ingestion and processing bottlenecks. API Gateway acts as a front door to the application but doesn't inherently provide scalability for the data processing pipeline itself. It also doesn't provide a retry mechanism for failed requests, which is one of the initial problems.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nis the most cost-efficient and reliable solution. Amazon EventBridge allows scheduling events using cron expressions, which perfectly fits the requirement of weekly execution. AWS Lambda provides a serverless execution environment for the Python script. Lambda is cost-effective because you only pay for the compute time used (approximately 5 minutes per week). EventBridge ensures reliable scheduling, and Lambda provides a scalable and fault-tolerant environment for running the script. This solution avoids the overhead of managing servers, making it the most suitable choice.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nAWS Glue is designed for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations and is generally more expensive than Lambda for simple script execution. While Glue can be scheduled, it's overkill for a simple database rollover script. The overhead of using Glue for this task is not cost-efficient.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nUsing an EC2 spot instance with a cron expression is less reliable and more complex than using Lambda and EventBridge. Spot instances can be terminated at any time, potentially interrupting the database rollover process. While cost-effective when available, the risk of interruption makes it less reliable. Managing an EC2 instance also adds operational overhead compared to a serverless solution.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nUsing an EC2 scheduled reserved instance is the least cost-efficient option. Reserved instances are billed regardless of usage, meaning you'll be paying for the instance even when it's idle for most of the week. This is not a cost-effective solution for a task that only runs for 5 minutes per week. Furthermore, managing an EC2 instance adds operational overhead compared to a serverless solution.",

    ],
    "explanation": "**Why option 3 is correct:**\nusing DynamoDB point-in-time recovery (PITR), is the most appropriate solution. PITR allows you to restore a DynamoDB table to any point in time during the preceding 35 days. This is ideal for recovering from accidental writes or deletions. The key advantage is the granularity of the recovery, allowing restoration to a state just before the corruption occurred, minimizing data loss. It's also a relatively quick operation compared to other options.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nconfiguring the DynamoDB table as a global table and switching to another region, is not a suitable solution for several reasons. Firstly, global tables are designed for low-latency global access and disaster recovery, not for correcting data corruption. Secondly, replicating data from a potentially corrupted table to another region is counterproductive. It also involves significant overhead and complexity for a simple data recovery task. Finally, it doesn't guarantee that the other region has a clean copy of the data, especially if the corruption has already replicated.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nusing DynamoDB Streams to restore the table, is also not the best approach. While DynamoDB Streams captures item-level changes, restoring the table using streams would involve replaying the stream events in reverse order to undo the corrupted writes. This is a complex and time-consuming process, especially if the corruption involves multiple writes or complex data transformations. It requires custom scripting and careful handling of dependencies, making it less efficient and more error-prone than PITR. It's more suitable for auditing or triggering actions based on data changes, not for rapid point-in-time recovery.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nusing DynamoDB on-demand backup to restore the table, is less ideal than PITR. While backups can be used for restoration, on-demand backups are typically taken periodically, not continuously. Therefore, restoring from a backup might result in a significant loss of data since the last backup. PITR provides a much finer granularity for recovery, allowing restoration to a point in time much closer to the corruption event, minimizing data loss. Also, restoring from a backup takes longer than restoring from PITR.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nCreating a read replica and directing the report generation tool to it is the most suitable solution. Read replicas provide a read-only copy of the data, allowing the reporting workload to be offloaded from the primary production database. This isolates the impact of the heavy reporting queries, preventing them from affecting the performance of the production application. This approach is also cost-effective because it avoids the need to significantly scale up the primary database instance. Read replicas are designed for read-heavy workloads like reporting and analytics.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nConfiguring the RDS instance to be Multi-AZ improves availability and provides failover capabilities in case of an outage, but it does not address the performance issue caused by the reporting workload. Multi-AZ provides a standby instance in a different Availability Zone, but all writes are still performed on the primary instance, and reads are typically served from the primary instance as well (unless using a custom endpoint for read-only traffic, which is not the primary purpose of Multi-AZ). Therefore, the reporting load would still impact the primary database.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nMigrating from General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3) to magnetic storage would significantly degrade performance, not enhance it. Magnetic storage offers much lower IOPS and throughput compared to SSDs, making it unsuitable for database workloads, especially those involving complex queries and large data retrieval. This option would exacerbate the performance issues.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nIncreasing the size of the Amazon RDS instance might provide some temporary relief, but it is not a cost-effective or sustainable solution. The question states that CPU, memory, and storage are only at 50% capacity, indicating that the bottleneck is not overall resource exhaustion. Scaling up the instance would increase costs without necessarily addressing the root cause of the performance issue, which is likely I/O contention or query performance. Offloading the reporting workload to a read replica is a more targeted and cost-effective approach.",
