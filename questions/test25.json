AD Connector allows AWS to connect to the on-premises Active Directory without replicating the directory in AWS, reducing operational overhead. IAM Identity Center provides centralized management of access to multiple AWS accounts within an AWS Organization. Permission sets in IAM Identity Center can be assigned based on Active Directory group membership, simplifying access control and ensuring compliance. This approach minimizes ongoing operational management by leveraging managed AWS services for identity federation and access control.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because manually creating IAM roles in each member account and instructing developers to assume roles is a highly manual and error-prone process. It doesn't provide centralized management or easy integration with the existing Active Directory. It also increases the operational burden and makes it difficult to maintain consistent access control policies across accounts. Control Tower helps with account provisioning but doesn't solve the identity management problem directly.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because deploying and managing an open-source identity provider (IdP) on Amazon EC2 adds significant operational overhead. It requires managing the EC2 instance, the IdP software, and the synchronization with Active Directory. While SAML federation is a valid approach, using a managed service like IAM Identity Center is more efficient and reduces the operational burden.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

SQS FIFO queues guarantee that messages are processed in the exact order they are sent. While FIFO queues have a lower throughput limit than standard queues, batching allows for increased throughput. Each batch counts as a single transaction towards the SQS limits. With a batch size of 4, the system only needs to perform 250 operations per second (1000 messages / 4 messages per batch = 250 operations), which is well within the SQS FIFO queue limits. This approach balances the need for ordered processing with the required throughput.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon SQS standard queue to process the messages, is incorrect because standard queues do not guarantee message order.

While this is still within SQS FIFO limits, a batch size of 4 (Option 0) is more efficient as it reduces the number of operations required to achieve the desired throughput, leading to lower costs and potentially better performance.",

Multipart upload allows breaking the file into smaller parts, which can be uploaded in parallel, improving throughput and resilience. S3TA uses Amazon's globally distributed edge locations to optimize the network path between the on-premises data center and the S3 bucket, reducing latency and improving transfer speeds, especially over long distances. This combination provides the fastest upload method.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because introducing an EC2 instance as an intermediary adds unnecessary complexity and latency. While the EC2 instance might be in the same region as the S3 bucket, the initial transfer from the on-premises data center to the EC2 instance would still be a bottleneck. Furthermore, transferring the file from EC2 to S3 adds another step, increasing the overall upload time.

Deploying an AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway on premises allows the company to present an NFS-compatible file share to their workloads. The File Gateway stores the uploaded files in Amazon S3, which provides virtually unlimited scalability and durability. S3 Lifecycle policies can then be used to automatically transition infrequently accessed objects to lower-cost storage classes like S3 Standard-IA or S3 Glacier, fulfilling the automated tiering requirement. This solution minimizes costs by leveraging S3's storage classes and allows the company to continue using their existing NFS-based tools and protocols, minimizing application changes. The File Gateway acts as a bridge between the on-premises NFS clients and the cloud-based S3 storage.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because while Amazon EFS provides NFS compatibility and lifecycle management, it's generally more expensive than using S3 for large-scale data storage, especially when considering infrequently accessed data. EFS One Zone-IA is cheaper than standard EFS, but S3 with lifecycle policies to Glacier or Deep Archive will be more cost-effective for long-term archival of infrequently accessed data. Also, migrating all data to EFS upfront might not be the most cost-effective approach if a significant portion of the data is rarely accessed.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because using a Storage Gateway Volume Gateway in cached mode and attaching it as a block device to an on-premises file server adds unnecessary complexity and overhead. It requires maintaining an on-premises file server, which defeats the purpose of migrating to a cloud-based solution to address scalability issues. While snapshots can be stored in S3 Glacier Deep Archive, this approach is not as cost-effective or efficient as directly storing files in S3 and using S3 Lifecycle policies for tiering. Also, managing recovery operations and tiering with AWS Backup is not the most efficient way to handle archival and tiering in this scenario. The primary goal is to move away from on-premises infrastructure, which this solution doesn't fully achieve.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

Deploy EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to retry transactions as needed.** RDS Proxy helps manage database connections, reducing the overhead on the Aurora database. It pools and reuses database connections, preventing connection exhaustion during peak loads. Deploying EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group ensures that the application can scale horizontally to handle increased traffic. Retrying transactions handles transient failures effectively. This combination addresses scalability and resilience without requiring database changes.\n\n*   **Option 3: Modify the application to publish purchase events to an Amazon SQS queue. Launch an Auto Scaling group of EC2 workers that poll the queue and process purchases asynchronously.** This implements an asynchronous processing pattern. Instead of directly processing purchases synchronously, the application publishes purchase events to an SQS queue. An Auto Scaling group of EC2 workers then consumes these events and processes the purchases in the background. This decouples the front-end application from the back-end processing, allowing the front-end to remain responsive even during peak loads. SQS provides buffering and ensures that no purchase events are lost. The Auto Scaling group scales the processing capacity based on the queue length, providing scalability and cost-efficiency.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nOption 1: Deploy read replicas for the Aurora database in another Region and configure EC2 instances to read and write from the nearest replica based on latency.

An outbound endpoint allows DNS queries originating from the VPC to be forwarded to on-premises DNS servers. The forwarding rule specifies which domain names (e.g., *.internal.example.com) should be routed to the on-premises DNS servers. This approach is secure because it only forwards specific queries to the on-premises DNS servers, rather than exposing the entire VPC's DNS resolution to the on-premises environment. Associating the rule with the VPC ensures that only resources within that VPC can use the rule.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because using a Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint would allow on-premises systems to resolve DNS records within the VPC, which is the opposite of what the question requires. The application in AWS needs to resolve on-premises DNS records, not the other way around.

It identifies potential compatibility issues and provides recommendations for resolving them. AWS DMS then migrates the data from the source SQL Server database to the target Aurora PostgreSQL database. This combination ensures that the database structure and data are migrated effectively.\n*   **Option 3: Deploy Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL to enable support for T-SQL commands:** Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL is a translation layer that allows Aurora PostgreSQL to understand and execute T-SQL commands. This is crucial because the existing applications are tightly integrated with T-SQL.

Instead, they are assumed by trusted entities (in this case, users from the development account).\n*   **Cross-Account Access:** To enable cross-account access, you create an IAM role in the production account that trusts the development account. This trust is established through a trust policy that specifies the AWS account ID of the development account as the principal.\n*   **Granting Permissions:** The IAM role in the production account is granted the necessary permissions to access the required resources. This is done through an IAM policy attached to the role.\n*   **Assuming the Role:** Users in the development account can then assume this role using the AWS CLI, SDK, or Management Console.

Instance store provides very high random I/O performance because the storage is physically attached to the host server. Since the application handles data replication and ensures data availability even if an instance fails, the ephemeral nature of instance store is acceptable. This avoids the cost overhead of persistent block storage like EBS or network file systems like EFS.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) based EC2 instances, is incorrect because EBS adds cost and complexity compared to instance store. While EBS can provide good performance, it's not as cost-effective as instance store when the application handles data replication and instance failure scenarios. The persistence offered by EBS is not necessary given the application's resilience.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nusing Amazon EC2 instances with Amazon EFS mount points, is incorrect because EFS is a network file system designed for shared access and scalability, not for high random I/O performance.

IRSA allows you to associate an IAM role with a Kubernetes service account. By creating separate service accounts for the UI and data services, and then mapping each service account to an IAM role with only the necessary permissions (DynamoDB for UI and S3 for data), you can achieve the desired least privilege access. This approach avoids granting excessive permissions to the underlying EC2 nodes or using a single shared service account, which would violate the principle of least privilege. IRSA uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to provide temporary credentials to the Pods, ensuring secure access to AWS resources.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because it violates the principle of least privilege.

Using a shared VPC or peered VPC allows the Lambda function in the central account to access the EFS mount target. EFS access points provide a controlled entry point to the file system, enforcing a specific user identity and root directory. This solution is scalable because EFS is designed to handle growing data volumes. It is cost-efficient because it avoids data duplication or complex data transfer mechanisms. It minimizes operational overhead by using managed services and established AWS security mechanisms.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because packaging the genomic input data as a Lambda layer is not suitable for large files.

Furthermore, managing and updating Lambda layers across accounts adds operational overhead.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because copying EFS contents to S3 using DataSync introduces data duplication, which increases storage costs. It also adds operational overhead for managing DataSync jobs and S3 access points. The Lambda function would need to be modified to use S3 API calls instead of file system operations, which is less efficient for genomics data analysis workloads that typically rely on file system access patterns.

It uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the nearest healthy endpoint based on network conditions and health checks. Global Accelerator supports UDP, which is crucial for the gaming application. Furthermore, it allows for fast regional failover, typically within seconds, by automatically redirecting traffic to a healthy region if one becomes unavailable. The static IP addresses also simplify integration with the company's custom DNS service since the DNS records can point to these static IPs, and Global Accelerator handles the underlying routing complexities.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nAWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is primarily a regional service. While Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB) support UDP, they do not inherently provide the global reach and fast failover capabilities required by the question. ELB requires integration with Route 53 for global distribution, which adds complexity and might not be as fast as Global Accelerator's failover mechanism. Also, the question mentions using a custom DNS service, making ELB less suitable for the global routing aspect.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nAmazon Route 53 is a DNS service, but it doesn't inherently provide the global traffic management and fast failover capabilities required for this scenario. While Route 53 can be configured for failover using health checks and routing policies, it relies on DNS propagation, which can take longer than Global Accelerator's failover time. The question specifies the use of a custom DNS service, so Route 53 is not the primary solution for global traffic management and failover.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nAmazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) primarily designed for caching and delivering static and dynamic content. While it can improve performance by caching content closer to users, it is not the best solution for a gaming application that relies on UDP and requires fast regional failover.

Amazon ECS with the Fargate launch type is used for the compute- and memory-intensive backend processing. Fargate eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances, allowing ECS to automatically provision and scale compute resources based on demand. This approach minimizes operational overhead and aligns with the requirement for a fully managed solution.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because Amazon SQS is primarily a message queuing service, not an API endpoint for receiving requests directly from mobile devices. While SQS can be used in conjunction with other services, it doesn't inherently provide the secure endpoint and request handling capabilities of API Gateway.

While it can be used to connect a data center to AWS, it doesn't inherently provide a dedicated, low-latency, high-throughput connection like Direct Connect. Also, Transit Gateway itself doesn't provide encryption; it would need to be configured separately, and it's not the primary solution for a dedicated, encrypted connection from a single data center.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nusing AWS Site-to-Site VPN to establish a connection between the data center and AWS Cloud, is incorrect. While Site-to-Site VPN provides encryption, it relies on the public internet, which can introduce latency and is not a dedicated connection. It also may not provide the high throughput required. It's a less expensive and simpler solution than Direct Connect, but it doesn't meet the low-latency and high-throughput requirements.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nThis is correct because it utilizes a scheduled action within the Auto Scaling Group. A scheduled action allows you to set the desired capacity of the ASG to 10 at the designated hour on the last day of each month. This ensures that the ASG scales out to the required number of instances *before* the peak traffic arrives, preventing performance lag. Setting the 'desired capacity' directly tells the ASG how many instances it should be running. The ASG will handle launching the necessary instances to meet this desired capacity.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nis incorrect because setting both the min and max count to 10 doesn't guarantee that the ASG will scale *before* the peak. It only ensures that the ASG can have a minimum and maximum of 10 instances. The initial capacity might still be 2, and the scaling event might happen *during* the peak, not before. The desired capacity is what triggers the scaling action.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nOptions 2 and 3 are incorrect because simple and target tracking scaling policies are designed to respond to changes in metrics (like CPU utilization or network traffic) in real-time. They are not suitable for predictable, scheduled scaling events. While they *could* eventually scale to 10 instances if the load increases, they won't proactively scale *before* the peak, leading to the same performance lag problem. Also, these policies don't directly allow you to set the instance count at a specific time.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nOptions 1 and 3 are the most cost-effective solutions.\n\n*   **Option 1: Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) to enable faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket:** S3 Transfer Acceleration utilizes globally distributed edge locations (CloudFront Edge Locations) to optimize the transfer of data to S3. When data is uploaded to an edge location, it is then transferred to the S3 bucket over the AWS backbone network, which is generally faster and more reliable than the public internet. This reduces latency and improves upload speeds, especially for geographically distant locations. It's designed specifically for this type of scenario and is generally cost-effective for large file transfers.\n\n*   **Option 3: Use multipart uploads for faster file uploads into the destination Amazon S3 bucket:** Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part can be uploaded independently, and in parallel. This can significantly improve upload speed, especially over unreliable networks, as individual parts can be retried without re-uploading the entire file. It also allows for uploading large files that exceed the single object size limit. It is a built-in S3 feature and doesn't incur additional costs beyond standard S3 storage and request charges. It also improves resilience to network interruptions.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nOption 2: Create multiple AWS Direct Connect connections between the AWS Cloud and branch offices in Europe and Asia. Use the direct connect connections for faster file uploads into Amazon S3. While Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection, it is very expensive to establish and maintain, especially across multiple geographically dispersed locations. It's overkill for simply improving S3 upload speeds and is not cost-effective. Direct Connect is more appropriate when you need consistent, high-bandwidth connectivity for hybrid cloud environments or have strict security requirements.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",
