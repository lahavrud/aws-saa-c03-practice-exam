    "explanation": "**Why option C is correct:**\nAWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that eliminates the need to provision, configure, or manage servers. When using ECS on Fargate, AWS handles all the underlying infrastructure management including server provisioning, patching, and scaling. This allows the company to focus entirely on maintaining their critical applications while AWS manages the container infrastructure. Fargate automatically scales containers based on demand and provides high availability across multiple Availability Zones, meeting the scalability and availability requirements without any infrastructure management overhead.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nUsing EC2 instances with Docker installed requires the company to provision, configure, and manage the EC2 instances themselves. This includes tasks like patching the operating system, managing security groups, configuring Auto Scaling, and ensuring high availability. This contradicts the requirement to not be responsible for provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nECS on EC2 worker nodes still requires the company to manage the EC2 instances that serve as worker nodes. The company must provision, configure, patch, and maintain these EC2 instances, handle Auto Scaling for the worker nodes, and ensure their availability. This does not meet the requirement of not managing the underlying infrastructure.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nThis option appears incomplete in the text, but even if it refers to ECS on EC2 instances, it still requires managing EC2 infrastructure.

It can handle massive throughput (up to thousands of data sources writing millions of records per second) and automatically scales to handle the 30 TB of daily clickstream data. Kinesis Data Streams provides low-latency data collection and can integrate with various AWS analytics services like Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift for real-time processing. It's the ideal service for collecting and transmitting clickstream data from 300+ websites and applications in real-time.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nAWS Data Pipeline is designed for batch data processing workflows, not real-time streaming data. It's meant for periodic, scheduled data transfers and transformations, not for continuous real-time clickstream data ingestion. Data Pipeline would introduce significant latency as it processes data in batches rather than streaming, which doesn't meet the real-time requirements for clickstream analysis.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nCreating an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances requires the company to manage the infrastructure, including provisioning instances, configuring scaling policies, managing instance health, and handling failures. This approach adds operational overhead and doesn't provide the managed, scalable solution that Kinesis Data Streams offers. Additionally, managing EC2 instances for this use case is more complex and less cost-effective than using a managed streaming service.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nAmazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service designed for caching and delivering static and dynamic content to end users with low latency.

    "explanation": "**Why option C is correct:**\nAurora multi-master clusters provide continuous write availability by allowing multiple database instances to accept write operations simultaneously. In a multi-master configuration, if one writer instance fails, the other writer instances can immediately continue handling write requests without any failover delay. This eliminates the single point of failure present in the standard Aurora configuration with one writer and multiple readers. The multi-master setup ensures that write operations can continue seamlessly through instance failover, meeting the requirement for continuous write availability.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nAdding a new AWS Region to the DB cluster creates a global database, but this doesn't provide continuous write availability through instance failover within the same region. Global databases are primarily designed for disaster recovery and read scaling across regions, not for handling failover scenarios within a single region. The failover process between regions would still involve some downtime and doesn't address the requirement for continuous write availability through instance failover.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nAdding a new reader instance in the same Availability Zone as the writer doesn't help with write availability. Reader instances in Aurora are read-only replicas that cannot accept write operations. Even if the writer fails, a reader cannot take over write operations. This option only improves read performance and redundancy for read operations, but does nothing to address continuous write availability through failover.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nAurora Parallel Query is a feature that accelerates analytical queries by parallelizing them across multiple Aurora replicas. However, it doesn't change the fundamental architecture of having a single writer instance. Parallel Query improves read performance for analytical workloads but doesn't provide multiple write endpoints or continuous write availability through failover.

    "explanation": "**Why option C is correct:**\nScheduled scaling allows you to configure the Auto Scaling group to automatically scale to a specific capacity at a predetermined time. Since the batch jobs always start at 1 AM with the same peak capacity every night, scheduled scaling can be configured to scale up to the desired capacity exactly at 1 AM, eliminating the 1-hour warm-up period. After the jobs complete, scheduled scaling can scale the group back down, reducing costs. This approach ensures the desired capacity is reached immediately when needed while maintaining cost-effectiveness by scaling down during non-peak hours.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nIncreasing the minimum capacity would keep instances running 24/7, even when batch jobs aren't running. This wastes money by paying for compute resources that aren't needed most of the time. While it would ensure capacity is available immediately, it doesn't address the cost-effectiveness requirement and doesn't solve the problem of reaching capacity quickly - it just keeps capacity always available at unnecessary cost.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nIncreasing the maximum capacity only sets the upper limit for scaling, but doesn't help the Auto Scaling group reach the desired capacity faster. The scaling process would still take the same amount of time (1 hour) to reach the desired capacity because the scaling policies and instance launch times remain unchanged. This option doesn't address the requirement to reach capacity quickly.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nChanging the scaling policy to add more instances per scaling operation might reduce the time slightly, but it doesn't guarantee reaching capacity exactly at 1 AM. The scaling would still be reactive and based on metrics, which introduces delay. More importantly, this doesn't leverage the predictable, scheduled nature of the workload.

    "explanation": "**Why option A is correct:**\nA gateway VPC endpoint provides private connectivity between resources in a VPC and AWS services like DynamoDB without requiring internet access, NAT devices, VPN connections, or AWS Direct Connect. Gateway VPC endpoints are free - there are no data processing charges, hourly charges, or data transfer charges for traffic within the same region. This makes it the most cost-effective solution. Additionally, gateway VPC endpoints are fully managed by AWS, requiring no ongoing management, which meets the requirement of not needing ongoing management. The endpoint automatically scales and provides high availability.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nA managed NAT Gateway still requires ongoing management in terms of monitoring, cost optimization, and ensuring high availability (though it's managed, you still need to configure and maintain it). More importantly, NAT Gateways incur hourly charges and data processing charges, making them significantly more expensive than gateway VPC endpoints. Since the requirement is to access DynamoDB (which supports VPC endpoints), using a NAT Gateway is unnecessarily costly and doesn't meet the cost-effectiveness requirement.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nAWS Direct Connect is designed for establishing dedicated network connections from on-premises to AWS, not for connecting VPC resources to AWS services like DynamoDB. Direct Connect is expensive, requires physical infrastructure setup, and is overkill for this use case. It doesn't provide the same cost benefits as VPC endpoints and doesn't meet the cost-effectiveness requirement. Additionally, it requires more management and setup than a simple VPC endpoint.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nAWS PrivateLink endpoint services are used to expose your own services privately to other VPCs or AWS accounts, not to access AWS managed services like DynamoDB.

Since the files are stored locally on the Storage Gateway appliance, the application experiences low latency. The files are automatically replicated to S3 without requiring code changes, meeting the requirement to copy files to AWS without application modifications.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nAmazon EFS uses the NFS protocol, not SMB, so it wouldn't be compatible with the existing SMB file share setup without significant changes. More importantly, accessing EFS over a VPN connection from on-premises would introduce latency, as the data would need to traverse the VPN connection for every file operation.

When a database record is updated (like marking a car as sold), RDS can publish an event to an SNS topic, which then invokes a Lambda function. The Lambda function can process the event, remove the listing from the website, and then use SNS's fanout capability to send the data to multiple target systems simultaneously. This serverless architecture provides automatic scaling, eliminates the need to manage infrastructure, and efficiently handles the requirement to send data to multiple systems.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nWhile this option also mentions Lambda triggered by RDS updates, the specific implementation details likely differ in a way that doesn't efficiently handle the fanout to multiple target systems. The correct solution leverages SNS's native fanout capability, which allows one message to be delivered to multiple subscribers (target systems) simultaneously, which is more efficient than sequential processing.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nSubscribing to RDS event notifications and sending to Amazon SQS creates a queue-based system, but SQS doesn't natively support fanout to multiple target systems. You would need separate queues for each target system and additional processing logic to distribute messages. This adds complexity and doesn't leverage the built-in fanout pattern that SNS provides. Additionally, SQS requires polling, which introduces latency compared to the push-based SNS approach.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nWhile RDS event notifications can be sent to SNS, this option likely doesn't include the Lambda function component needed to process the event and remove the listing from the website. SNS alone can distribute messages, but you still need a compute component (Lambda) to handle the business logic of updating the website and processing the data before sending it to target systems.

Standard queues are more cost-effective than FIFO queues and provide sufficient ordering for this use case where you just need to ensure paid videos are processed before free videos. The application logic can check the paid tier queue first, and only process free tier videos when the paid tier queue is empty. This meets the requirement while being the most cost-effective solution.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nUsing a FIFO queue for the paid tier and a standard queue for the free tier would work functionally, but FIFO queues are more expensive than standard queues due to the additional processing required to maintain strict ordering. Since the requirement only needs to ensure paid videos are processed before free videos (not strict ordering within each tier), standard queues for both tiers provide the same functionality at lower cost, making this option less cost-effective.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nA single FIFO queue for all file types would process videos in strict first-in-first-out order, which means if a free tier video arrives before a paid tier video, it would be processed first.

Additionally, FIFO queues are more expensive than standard queues, making this less cost-effective than using two standard queues.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nA single standard queue for all file types would process videos in the order they arrive, regardless of tier.

It can inspect and filter all traffic flowing in and out of the VPC through internet gateways, NAT gateways, VPN connections, or AWS Direct Connect. Network Firewall provides the same traffic inspection and filtering functionalities that the on-premises inspection server provided, but as a fully managed AWS service. It supports custom rule sets and integrates with AWS managed rule sets for common protections.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nAmazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that uses machine learning to identify potential security threats by analyzing CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. However, GuardDuty is a monitoring and detection service, not a firewall that can actively inspect and filter traffic in real-time. It doesn't perform traffic flow inspection or filtering at the network level like the on-premises inspection server did. GuardDuty detects threats but doesn't block or filter traffic.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nTraffic Mirroring is a feature that copies network traffic from EC2 instances to monitoring and security appliances for analysis. However, Traffic Mirroring only mirrors traffic - it doesn't perform active inspection and filtering of traffic flowing in and out of the VPC. It's a passive monitoring tool that requires additional security appliances to analyze the mirrored traffic. It doesn't replace the functionality of an inspection server that actively filters traffic.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nAWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that helps centrally configure and manage firewall rules across multiple AWS accounts and resources. However, Firewall Manager is a management and policy enforcement tool, not the actual firewall that performs traffic inspection and filtering. Firewall Manager works with AWS WAF, AWS Shield, and AWS Network Firewall to apply rules, but it doesn't itself inspect or filter traffic. You still need AWS Network Firewall to actually perform the inspection and filtering functions.",

    "explanation": "**Why option A is correct:**\nIAM roles are the recommended and secure way to grant EC2 instances access to AWS services like S3. When you attach an IAM role to an EC2 instance, the instance automatically receives temporary security credentials that allow it to access the S3 bucket. These credentials are automatically rotated and never need to be stored on the instance. Roles eliminate the need to manage access keys and provide better security than storing credentials on the instance. The role can be attached to the instance when it's launched or at any time, and the permissions are automatically applied.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nAn IAM policy alone cannot grant access to EC2 instances. Policies are documents that define permissions, but they must be attached to an IAM identity (user, group, or role) to be effective. You cannot directly attach a policy to an EC2 instance. To grant EC2 instances access to S3, you need to create a role, attach the policy to that role, and then associate the role with the EC2 instance.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nIAM groups are collections of IAM users, not EC2 instances. Groups are used to manage permissions for multiple users at once, but they cannot be associated with EC2 instances. EC2 instances cannot be members of IAM groups. To grant EC2 instances access to S3, you must use IAM roles, not groups.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nWhile you could create an IAM user and store access keys on the EC2 instance, this is not a recommended practice for several reasons. First, it requires managing and securely storing credentials on the instance, which is a security risk. Second, access keys don't automatically rotate and must be manually updated. Third, if the instance is compromised, the credentials could be exposed. IAM roles are the secure, AWS-recommended approach that eliminates these security concerns.",

    "explanation": "**Why option A is correct:**\nCreating an Amazon SQS queue provides a durable, stateless message queue that can store image processing requests. When images are uploaded to S3, events can be published to SQS, which will durably store the messages even if the processing Lambda function is temporarily unavailable. SQS ensures messages are not lost and provides at-least-once delivery, making it a durable component. The queue itself is stateless and managed by AWS, requiring no infrastructure management.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nConfiguring the Lambda function to use SQS as an event source is part of the solution, but this option alone doesn't create the durable queue component needed. You first need to create the SQS queue, then configure the Lambda function to consume from it. This option describes the integration step, not the creation of the durable component itself.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nWhile Lambda can be triggered directly by S3 events, this creates a tight coupling and doesn't provide the durability and decoupling that SQS offers. If the Lambda function fails or is throttled, S3 events might be lost. Additionally, S3 event notifications have limitations on retry behavior. Using SQS as an intermediary provides better durability, retry logic, and decoupling between the upload and processing steps.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nLaunching an EC2 instance to monitor SQS introduces stateful infrastructure that requires ongoing management, patching, and monitoring. This contradicts the requirement for stateless components and increases operational overhead. EC2 instances are not stateless - they have persistent state, require management, and add unnecessary complexity when Lambda can directly consume from SQS without any EC2 instances.\n\n**Why option E is incorrect:**\nWhile EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) can monitor S3 buckets and trigger Lambda functions, it doesn't provide the same level of durability and message persistence that SQS offers. EventBridge is an event router, not a message queue. If the Lambda function fails, EventBridge events might not be retried as reliably as SQS messages. SQS provides better durability guarantees and is more suitable for ensuring no messages are lost.",

GWLB endpoints can be deployed in the application VPC, and all traffic destined for the web servers is automatically routed through the inspection VPC where the firewall appliance is deployed. This provides inline traffic inspection with minimal operational overhead, as GWLB handles load distribution, health checks, and automatic scaling of the appliance fleet. The solution centralizes the firewall in the inspection VPC while seamlessly routing traffic from the application VPC through it.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nA Network Load Balancer (NLB) in the application VPC cannot route traffic to a firewall appliance in a different VPC (inspection VPC) without additional networking components. NLBs operate within a single VPC and are designed to distribute traffic to targets within that VPC. To route traffic to the inspection VPC, you would need Transit Gateway or VPC peering, which adds complexity. Gateway Load Balancer is specifically designed for this cross-VPC appliance inspection use case.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nAn Application Load Balancer (ALB) operates at Layer 7 (application layer) and is designed for HTTP/HTTPS traffic distribution to application servers. It cannot route traffic to a Layer 3 firewall appliance in a different VPC. ALBs also operate within a single VPC and don't have the cross-VPC capabilities that Gateway Load Balancer provides. Additionally, ALBs add unnecessary overhead for simple traffic inspection use cases.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nDeploying a Transit Gateway in the inspection VPC alone doesn't provide the traffic routing and load balancing needed for the firewall appliance.

This minimizes the time required to clone production data into the test environment while ensuring the cloned volumes have consistently high I/O performance from the start. The cloned volumes are independent copies, so modifications won't affect production.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nWhile taking EBS snapshots is the first step in cloning data, standard snapshots don't provide fast snapshot restore capabilities. Volumes created from standard snapshots experience lazy loading, where data blocks are loaded on first access, causing inconsistent I/O performance initially. This doesn't meet the requirement for consistently high I/O performance from the start.

CloudFront caches content at edge locations worldwide, delivering content to users with millisecond latency. S3 can handle unlimited storage and requests, automatically scaling to millions of requests per hour. For dynamic content (like the daily deal), you can use serverless components like API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB, which also scale automatically. This architecture provides minimal operational overhead as all components are fully managed by AWS and scale automatically without manual intervention.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nHosting the full website in different S3 buckets doesn't provide a complete solution. While S3 can host static content, a one-deal-a-day website likely needs dynamic functionality to update the deal each day, handle user interactions, and process transactions. S3 alone cannot handle dynamic content generation or server-side logic. You need additional services like Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to handle the dynamic aspects of the application.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nDeploying the full website on EC2 instances with Auto Scaling groups requires significant operational overhead. You need to manage the EC2 instances, configure Auto Scaling policies, handle patching and security updates, monitor instance health, and ensure the application can scale to handle millions of requests. While EC2 can handle the load, it requires ongoing management and doesn't provide the millisecond latency that CloudFront edge caching offers. This approach has higher operational overhead than a serverless architecture.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nMigrating to containers (ECS/EKS) still requires managing the underlying infrastructure, container orchestration, scaling policies, and load balancing. While containers provide portability and scalability, they don't eliminate operational overhead.

It automatically moves objects between four access tiers (Frequent Access, Infrequent Access, Archive Instant Access, and Archive Access) based on changing access patterns. This optimizes costs automatically - frequently accessed files stay in the frequent access tier, while rarely accessed files move to lower-cost tiers. Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and moves objects between tiers without performance impact or operational overhead. It provides the same durability as S3 Standard (99.999999999% across multiple Availability Zones) while minimizing costs for unpredictable access patterns.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nS3 Standard is designed for frequently accessed data and provides the highest performance, but it's also the most expensive storage class. Since the scenario mentions that some files are rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern, using S3 Standard for all files would result in paying premium storage costs for infrequently accessed data. S3 Standard doesn't automatically optimize costs based on access patterns like Intelligent-Tiering does.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nS3 Standard-IA is designed for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. However, Standard-IA requires you to know in advance that data will be infrequently accessed. Since the access pattern is unpredictable (some files accessed frequently, others rarely), you can't predict which files should be in Standard-IA. Additionally, Standard-IA has a minimum storage duration charge and retrieval fees, which may not be cost-effective if access patterns change. Intelligent-Tiering automatically handles this optimization.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nS3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single Availability Zone, which means it's not resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. The requirement explicitly states that files must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. One Zone-IA provides 99.5% availability within a single AZ, but if that AZ fails, the data becomes unavailable.

If you anticipate more users in the future, you would need to manually scale up to a larger instance type, which requires downtime or a maintenance window. Aurora Serverless eliminates this need by automatically scaling capacity based on demand.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nAmazon Redshift Spectrum is a feature that allows Redshift to query data directly from S3, not a database service for migrating MySQL databases. Redshift is a data warehousing service designed for analytical workloads, not transactional databases like MySQL. It uses a columnar storage format optimized for analytics, not row-based transactional operations. Redshift Spectrum cannot host a MySQL database or serve as a replacement for MySQL workloads.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nAmazon RDS for MySQL requires you to select a specific instance type when creating the database instance. Like Aurora MySQL, you must choose from predefined instance types (db.t3.micro, db.m5.large, etc.) based on your expected workload. If you need more capacity in the future, you must manually modify the instance to a larger type, which may require downtime. RDS doesn't automatically scale compute capacity like Aurora Serverless does.",

These volumes are designed for I/O-intensive workloads that require low latency and consistent performance. The root volume must be an SSD volume (gp2, gp3, io1, or io2) as EC2 instances require SSD for the root volume. By using a General Purpose SSD (gp2) for the root volume and Provisioned IOPS SSD for the data volume, you get the required configurable IOPS for transactional data while maintaining a cost-effective root volume.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nThroughput Optimized HDD (st1) volumes are designed for large, sequential workloads like big data, data warehouses, and log processing. They don't support configurable IOPS - st1 volumes have a baseline throughput that scales with volume size, but you cannot specify IOPS. Additionally, st1 volumes cannot be used as root volumes - EC2 instances require SSD volumes for the root volume. Cold HDD (sc1) volumes are even less suitable, designed for less frequently accessed data with the lowest cost.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nUsing st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD) as a data volume doesn't provide configurable IOPS. st1 volumes are optimized for throughput (MB/s) rather than IOPS, and they're designed for sequential workloads, not the random I/O patterns typical of transactional databases. st1 volumes cannot be configured with specific IOPS values - they provide baseline throughput that scales with volume size, which doesn't meet the requirement for configurable and consistent IOPS.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nGeneral Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes provide baseline IOPS of 3 IOPS per GB, with the ability to burst up to 3,000 IOPS. However, gp2 volumes don't allow you to provision specific IOPS values like Provisioned IOPS volumes do. While gp2 can provide good performance, it doesn't offer the configurable, consistent IOPS that Provisioned IOPS volumes (io1/io2) provide.

The device is shipped to your data center, where you connect it to your network and transfer the 60 TB of data. Snowball uses 256-bit encryption and supports encryption in transit.

    "explanation": "**Why option C is correct:**\nDeploying models as AWS Lambda functions behind a single API Gateway with path-based routing is the most cost-effective solution. Lambda automatically scales from zero to handle sporadic usage patterns, so you only pay when models are invoked. During idle periods, there are no charges for compute resources. Lambda functions can load the 10 GB of data from S3 into memory (/tmp directory) when invoked, and the data persists in memory during the function's execution. A single API Gateway can route requests to different Lambda functions based on the URL path, eliminating the need for multiple API Gateways. Lambda provides high availability automatically and low latency when functions are warm. This serverless approach minimizes costs for sporadically used models.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nDeploying a separate API Gateway for each of hundreds of machine learning models creates unnecessary complexity and cost. Each API Gateway incurs monthly charges and request fees. Managing hundreds of API Gateways increases operational overhead significantly. Additionally, Lambda functions have a 10 GB limit for the /tmp directory, which matches the requirement, but having separate API Gateways doesn't provide any benefit over a single API Gateway with path-based routing.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nAmazon ECS services require running container instances continuously or using Fargate, which incurs charges even when models aren't being used. For sporadically used models, keeping ECS tasks running 24/7 wastes money. While ECS can scale, it doesn't scale to zero like Lambda does. ECS also requires more operational overhead for container management, image building, and service configuration. The cost of maintaining hundreds of ECS services for sporadically used models would be significantly higher than Lambda.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nSimilar to option B, deploying models as ECS services behind a single API Gateway still requires running container instances continuously. ECS doesn't scale to zero, so you pay for compute resources even when models aren't being used.

If the primary database fails, RDS automatically fails over to the standby replica with minimal downtime (typically 60-120 seconds). Multi-AZ deployments are fully managed by AWS, requiring minimal manual intervention. The database automatically handles failover, backups, and maintenance operations, meeting the requirement for high availability with little manual intervention.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nCreating an RDS instance with manual replicas in another Availability Zone describes Multi-AZ deployment, but the phrasing suggests manually creating and managing replicas, which adds operational overhead. Multi-AZ deployment is an automated feature where AWS manages the standby replica automatically. The correct answer (option A) specifically mentions Multi-AZ mode, which is the managed, automated solution that requires minimal manual intervention.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nCreating an EC2 instance-based Docker cluster requires significant manual intervention. You must provision, configure, and manage EC2 instances, install Docker, set up container orchestration, configure networking, handle patching and security updates, and manage scaling. This approach requires ongoing operational overhead and doesn't meet the requirement for minimal manual intervention. ECS Fargate (option D) provides the same container functionality without EC2 management.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nWhile ECS with Fargate launch type is a correct choice for container-based applications with minimal manual intervention (Fargate manages the infrastructure), the question asks for two solutions. Option A (RDS Multi-AZ) addresses the relational database requirement, and ECS Fargate would address the container-based application requirement. However, since only option A is marked as correct in the current data, this might be a data issue, or the question may be focusing on the database solution specifically.\n\n**Why option E is incorrect:**\nECS with EC2 launch type requires managing the underlying EC2 instances, including provisioning, patching, scaling, and monitoring.

By caching common read requests in ElastiCache (using Redis or Memcached), the application can serve cached data directly from memory without querying the database. Since the scenario states that a small percentage of stale data is acceptable, caching is perfect - cached data may be slightly stale, but the performance gain (sub-millisecond responses) outweighs this trade-off. ElastiCache automatically handles cache management, scaling, and high availability, requiring minimal operational overhead.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nRDS read replicas can improve read performance by distributing read traffic across multiple database instances, but they don't provide sub-millisecond response times. Read replicas still require database queries, which typically take several milliseconds even with optimized queries. Read replicas help with read scaling but don't achieve the sub-millisecond latency that in-memory caching provides. Additionally, read replicas may have replication lag, which could result in stale data, but the primary benefit is read scaling, not ultra-low latency.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nBuilding the database as a larger instance type can improve performance by providing more CPU, memory, and network capacity, but it still won't achieve sub-millisecond response times for database queries. Even the largest RDS instances have query latency measured in milliseconds, not sub-milliseconds. Larger instances help with overall throughput and reduce query time, but they don't eliminate the fundamental latency of database operations. In-memory caching is required to achieve sub-millisecond response times.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nAmazon Elasticsearch Service (now OpenSearch Service) is designed for search and analytics workloads, not for caching database queries. While it can provide fast search capabilities, it's not a drop-in replacement for database caching.

When a file is uploaded to S3, an event notification is sent to the SQS queue. Lambda automatically polls the SQS queue and processes messages as they arrive, transforming the data and saving it as JSON. This solution scales automatically - Lambda handles high volumes of uploads by processing multiple files concurrently, and scales down to zero when there are no files. SQS provides durability and ensures no events are lost. All components are fully managed by AWS, requiring no infrastructure management.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nAmazon EMR is a big data processing service designed for large-scale data processing jobs, not for processing individual small files as they're uploaded. EMR requires cluster provisioning, configuration, and management, which adds significant operational overhead. EMR is designed for batch processing of large datasets, not real-time processing of individual files. The overhead of managing EMR clusters doesn't meet the requirement for least operational overhead, and EMR doesn't automatically scale based on file uploads.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nWhile S3 can send event notifications to SQS, this option likely describes an incomplete solution that doesn't include the Lambda function component needed to process the files. SQS alone cannot transform data or save it as JSON - you need a compute service like Lambda to perform the processing. The complete solution requires S3 -> SQS -> Lambda, not just S3 -> SQS.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nWhile EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) can monitor S3 buckets and trigger Lambda functions, it's designed as an event router rather than a message queue. EventBridge doesn't provide the same durability guarantees and message persistence that SQS offers. For file processing workflows where you want to ensure no files are missed and provide better retry logic, SQS is more appropriate.

The IP address 10.100.100.254 falls within this CIDR block (10.100.100.0/24), so a user connecting from this IP address can terminate EC2 instances in the us-east-1 region.

The Deny statement blocks EC2 actions in all regions except us-east-1, meaning us-east-1 is the only region where EC2 actions are permitted (subject to the IP restriction for termination). Users cannot terminate instances in regions other than us-east-1, but they can terminate in us-east-1 if their source IP matches.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nThe policy doesn't restrict termination based on the EC2 instance's IP address (10.100.100.1). The IP address condition in IAM policies applies to the source IP address of the user making the API call, not the IP address of the EC2 instance being terminated. The condition checks where the API request is coming from (the user's network), not the target instance's IP address.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nThis option states the opposite of what the policy allows.

It provides native SMB protocol support, which is required for Windows shared file storage. FSx integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Active Directory for authentication and authorization, allowing you to use existing AD credentials and groups. FSx provides high availability through Multi-AZ deployments, automatically replicating data across multiple Availability Zones and providing automatic failover. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for on-premises Windows file servers, making it ideal for migrating SharePoint deployments.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nAmazon EFS uses the NFS protocol, not SMB, so it's not compatible with Microsoft SharePoint or Windows shared file storage. SharePoint requires SMB protocol for file shares. Additionally, while EFS can integrate with Active Directory through AWS Directory Service, it's primarily designed for Linux workloads. EFS doesn't provide the native Windows file server functionality that SharePoint requires, and the NFS protocol is not compatible with Windows file sharing requirements.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nAWS Storage Gateway File Gateway can present an SMB share, but it's designed as a hybrid solution that caches data locally while storing it in S3. File Gateway is typically deployed on-premises or in a hybrid configuration, not as a primary storage solution for cloud-native workloads. While it can work, FSx for Windows File Server is specifically designed for this use case and provides better integration with Active Directory and Windows applications. Additionally, the requirement is for a cloud migration, not a hybrid solution.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nAmazon S3 is an object storage service, not a file system. While there are tools that can mount S3 as a volume on Windows Server, this approach has significant limitations. S3 doesn't provide native SMB protocol support, doesn't integrate well with Active Directory for fine-grained access control, and doesn't provide the file system semantics that SharePoint requires. S3 is designed for object storage, not for shared file storage with Windows applications. FSx for Windows File Server is the appropriate managed service for this requirement.",

    "explanation": "**Why option C is correct:**\nThe visibility timeout is the period during which SQS hides a message from other consumers after it's been received. If the Lambda function takes longer than the visibility timeout to process a message, the message becomes visible again and can be processed by another Lambda invocation, causing duplicate processing. By increasing the visibility timeout to a value greater than the Lambda function's execution time plus any retry overhead, you ensure that the message remains hidden long enough for processing to complete. This prevents duplicate processing with minimal operational overhead - it's just a configuration change to the SQS queue.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nLong polling reduces the number of empty responses when polling SQS, which can reduce costs and improve efficiency, but it doesn't prevent duplicate message processing. Long polling affects how Lambda polls for messages, not how messages are handled after they're received. The duplicate processing issue is caused by the visibility timeout being too short, not by the polling method.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nChanging from a standard queue to a FIFO queue would prevent duplicates by ensuring exactly-once processing, but FIFO queues have limitations: they support up to 3,000 messages per second with batching, or 300 messages per second without batching. Standard queues support nearly unlimited throughput. If the application needs high throughput, FIFO queues might not be suitable. Additionally, FIFO queues require message groups and deduplication IDs, which adds complexity. Increasing visibility timeout is simpler and doesn't require changing the queue type.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nModifying the Lambda function to delete messages immediately after processing would require code changes and doesn't solve the root cause. The issue is that if the Lambda function fails or times out before completing processing, the message should remain in the queue for retry. Deleting messages immediately would cause message loss if processing fails. Additionally, Lambda automatically deletes messages from SQS after successful processing, so manual deletion isn't necessary. The proper solution is to configure the visibility timeout correctly.",

The solution is fully managed by AWS, requiring minimal operational overhead - you create the key and grant the application permission to use it.

Secrets Manager can store certificates, but it's optimized for secrets that are retrieved via API calls, not for certificates that need to be downloaded and used by applications in near real-time. Additionally, Secrets Manager has size limitations and cost considerations that may not be suitable for certificate storage at scale.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nCreating a Lambda function with a Python cryptography library adds unnecessary complexity and operational overhead.

    "explanation": "**Why option A is correct:**\nNAT gateways are AWS-managed services that allow instances in private subnets to initiate outbound connections to the internet while preventing inbound connections from the internet. To achieve high availability across three Availability Zones, you need one NAT gateway in each AZ's public subnet. Each private subnet's route table should route internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT gateway in its corresponding AZ. This ensures that if one AZ fails, the other AZs can still provide internet access. NAT gateways are highly available within each AZ and automatically scale to handle the traffic load.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nNAT instances are EC2 instances that you manage yourself, requiring ongoing maintenance, patching, and monitoring. While you could deploy NAT instances in private subnets, NAT gateways should be deployed in public subnets (not private subnets) because they need direct access to the internet gateway. More importantly, NAT instances require manual management and don't provide the same level of availability and automatic scaling that managed NAT gateways provide. NAT instances are a legacy approach that adds operational overhead.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nInternet gateways cannot be attached to private subnets - they must be attached to the VPC and route tables determine which subnets can use them. Even if you could attach an internet gateway to a private subnet, this would expose the private instances directly to the internet, defeating the purpose of having private subnets. Private subnets are designed to have no direct internet connectivity for security. NAT gateways provide the secure outbound-only internet access that private subnets need.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nEgress-only internet gateways are used for IPv6 traffic, not IPv4. The scenario specifies that the VPC uses IPv4 CIDR blocks. For IPv4 private subnets, you need NAT gateways (or NAT instances) to provide outbound internet access. Egress-only internet gateways serve the same purpose for IPv6 that NAT gateways serve for IPv4, but they cannot be used for IPv4 traffic.",

    "explanation": "**Why option A is correct:**\nLaunching the EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system minimizes latency and data transfer costs. When the EC2 instance and EFS are in the same AZ, data transfers between them don't incur cross-AZ data transfer charges. This is important for the initial data migration and ongoing operations. EFS is accessible across all AZs in a region, but placing the instance in the same AZ as EFS provides optimal performance.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nInstalling an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center is actually a correct step for automating the data transfer. DataSync is designed to automate and accelerate data transfers between on-premises storage and AWS services. The agent would be installed on-premises to read from the NFS file system and transfer data to EFS. However, since this is a \"choose two\" question and only option A is marked as correct in the current data, there may be a data issue, or the question may focus on the EC2/EFS configuration rather than the transfer method.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nCreating a secondary EBS volume on the EC2 instance doesn't help with the migration task. The requirement is to transfer data from the on-premises NFS file system to EFS, not to store it on EBS. EBS volumes are block storage attached to EC2 instances, while EFS is the network file system that the application will use. Adding an EBS volume doesn't automate the transfer process or help migrate data to EFS.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nManually using operating system copy commands doesn't meet the requirement to automate the task. Manual copying requires ongoing intervention, is error-prone, and doesn't provide the automation, error handling, and progress tracking that AWS DataSync provides. Manual copying also doesn't scale well and requires the administrator to monitor and manage the transfer process.\n\n**Why option E is incorrect:**\nWhile AWS DataSync can create location configurations, this option alone doesn't complete the automation setup. You need both the on-premises agent (option B) and the location configuration to fully automate the transfer.

This prevents reprocessing of old XML data files and ensures that only new data added daily to the S3 bucket is processed, significantly reducing processing time and costs. Job bookmarks work automatically once enabled and require no additional configuration.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nDeleting data after processing would remove the source data from S3, which may not be desirable if the data needs to be retained for compliance, auditing, or other purposes. Additionally, deleting data doesn't prevent Glue from reprocessing it - if the data is deleted, there's nothing to reprocess, but this approach loses the historical data. Job bookmarks provide a better solution by tracking what's been processed without requiring data deletion.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nSetting the NumberOfWorkers field to 1 reduces the parallelism of the Glue job, which may slow down processing but doesn't prevent reprocessing of old data.

GuardDuty provides alerts and findings, but you would need additional services like Shield or WAF to actually block attacks.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nWhile CloudFront can help distribute traffic and provide some DDoS protection through its edge locations, using CloudFront alone doesn't provide comprehensive DDoS protection against large-scale attacks. CloudFront is a CDN that caches content and distributes traffic, but for Windows web servers running on EC2, you need Shield Advanced for dedicated DDoS protection. CloudFront can be part of a defense-in-depth strategy but isn't sufficient on its own for mitigating large-scale DDoS attacks.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nUsing a Lambda function to add attacker IP addresses to VPC network ACLs is reactive and doesn't scale well for attacks from thousands of IP addresses.

Additionally, using `*` as the resource grants permissions to all Lambda functions, which is overly permissive. Resource-based policies control who can invoke the function, not what the function can do.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nSimilar to option A, execution roles define what the Lambda function can do, not who can invoke it. The execution role is used by the Lambda service to assume permissions on behalf of the function when it runs. To allow EventBridge to invoke the function, you need a resource-based policy on the function, not an execution role. Execution roles and resource-based policies serve different purposes in Lambda security.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nUsing `lambda:*` as the action grants all Lambda permissions, not just `InvokeFunction`. This violates the principle of least privilege by granting more permissions than necessary. The principle of least privilege requires granting only the minimum permissions needed - in this case, only `lambda:InvokeFunction` should be granted, not all Lambda permissions. Additionally, the resource should be the specific function ARN, not a wildcard, to further restrict permissions.",

    "explanation": "**Why option B is correct:**\nA gateway VPC endpoint for S3 provides private connectivity between resources in the VPC and S3 without requiring internet access through NAT instances or NAT gateways. This eliminates data transfer costs through NAT devices, as traffic to S3 stays within the AWS network. Gateway endpoints are free - there are no hourly charges or data processing charges. By routing S3 traffic through the gateway endpoint instead of NAT instances, the company eliminates NAT data transfer costs, which is the primary cost concern. Gateway endpoints automatically scale and require no management.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nReplacing NAT instances with NAT gateways improves availability and reduces management overhead, but it doesn't reduce data transfer costs. NAT gateways still charge for data processing and data transfer, so the cost concern remains. Gateway VPC endpoints eliminate NAT costs entirely for S3 traffic, making them the cost-effective solution. NAT gateways are better than NAT instances for availability, but gateway endpoints are better for cost reduction.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nS3 does not support interface endpoints (PrivateLink). Interface endpoints are only available for services that integrate with AWS PrivateLink, and S3 is not on that list. S3 uses gateway endpoints, which operate differently - they're not ENIs in your VPC but rather route table entries that direct S3 traffic to AWS's network. Interface endpoints are for services like API Gateway, KMS, and other PrivateLink-enabled services, not S3.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nConfiguring CloudFront for the S3 bucket creates a CDN that caches content at edge locations, which can reduce data transfer costs for content delivery to end users. However, CloudFront doesn't help with data transfer costs between ECS tasks and S3 within AWS. The cost concern is about ECS accessing S3, not end users accessing content. CloudFront is for content delivery, not for reducing costs of ECS-to-S3 data transfers. Gateway endpoints are the solution for reducing VPC-to-S3 transfer costs.",

The AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) converts the database schema from Oracle to PostgreSQL format. DMS supports ongoing replication, so as applications are migrated one by one over several months, the databases remain synchronized. DMS handles the high number of reads and writes efficiently and can scale to handle the workload. This solution allows for a gradual migration while maintaining data consistency.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nAWS DataSync is designed for one-time or scheduled data transfers between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services like S3 or EFS. It's not designed for continuous database replication or keeping databases in sync. DataSync doesn't support Change Data Capture (CDC) or real-time replication between databases. For keeping an Oracle database and Aurora PostgreSQL in sync during a gradual migration, you need DMS, not DataSync.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nThis option is identical to option A - DataSync is not suitable for continuous database replication. DataSync is for file-based data transfers, not for database replication with CDC capabilities. The requirement to keep databases in sync throughout a multi-month migration requires continuous replication, which DMS provides but DataSync does not.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nThis option appears identical to option C (Schema Conversion Tool with DMS), but there may be a subtle difference in the implementation details or the question may be testing understanding of the specific DMS configuration needed.

S3 provides 99.999999999% durability and can store data indefinitely at a fraction of the cost of high-performance storage. For HPC applications where data is only accessed when the application runs periodically, S3 provides economical cold storage that can be accessed when needed.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nAmazon EFS is designed for shared file storage with low-latency access, not for cold storage. EFS is optimized for frequently accessed data and provides consistent, low-latency performance, which comes at a higher cost than S3. EFS doesn't have the same cost-effective storage classes for infrequently accessed data. For cold storage that's only accessed periodically, S3 is more cost-effective than EFS.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nS3 is not designed for high-performance parallel storage. While S3 can handle high throughput, it doesn't provide the low-latency, parallel file system performance that HPC applications require during active runs. S3 has higher latency than file systems and isn't optimized for the parallel I/O patterns typical of HPC workloads.

    "explanation": "**Why option C is correct:**\nHorizontal scaling using Auto Scaling groups with an Application Load Balancer allows the application to automatically add or remove instances based on demand, handling traffic spikes by distributing load across multiple instances. The ALB distributes incoming requests across healthy instances in the Auto Scaling group, preventing any single instance from becoming a bottleneck. When traffic spikes occur, Auto Scaling automatically launches additional instances to handle the increased load, then scales down when traffic decreases. This approach maintains response times during traffic volume spikes by adding capacity rather than trying to make a single instance faster.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nVertically scaling (increasing instance size) provides more CPU, memory, and network capacity to a single instance, but it has limitations. There's a maximum instance size, and vertical scaling requires downtime or instance replacement. More importantly, a single larger instance can still become a bottleneck during traffic spikes, and vertical scaling doesn't provide the same level of fault tolerance and load distribution that horizontal scaling provides. Horizontal scaling is more effective for handling unpredictable traffic spikes.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nScaling the persistence layer (database) horizontally with Oracle RAC addresses database bottlenecks but doesn't solve the application tier bottlenecks mentioned in the scenario. The problem states that bottlenecks occur in the application tier, not the database tier. While database scaling might help overall performance, it doesn't address the specific issue of application tier bottlenecks during traffic spikes. Additionally, Oracle RAC on AWS is complex and expensive compared to managed database services.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nDecoupling using SQS would require changing the application architecture from synchronous to asynchronous transactions. The scenario explicitly states the application uses synchronous transactions, and changing this would require significant application code changes. Decoupling might help long-term, but it doesn't address the immediate need to handle traffic spikes while maintaining current response times. Horizontal scaling with Auto Scaling and ALB can be implemented without changing the application architecture.",

    "explanation": "**Why option A is correct:**\nEnabling EBS encryption by default for the AWS Region ensures that all new EBS volumes created in that region are automatically encrypted, including volumes restored from snapshots. When you restore an unencrypted snapshot with encryption by default enabled, the restored volume will be encrypted even though the source snapshot was unencrypted. This is a region-level setting that applies to all volumes created in that region, ensuring consistent encryption without requiring manual configuration for each volume. This meets the requirement to ensure all volumes restored from unencrypted snapshots are encrypted.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nEBS encryption by default cannot be enabled for specific volumes - it's a region-level setting that applies to all volumes in the region. You cannot selectively enable encryption by default for only certain volumes. The setting is either enabled for the entire region or not enabled at all. To ensure all restored volumes are encrypted, you must enable encryption by default at the region level.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nManually creating volumes and specifying a CMK for encryption requires manual intervention for each volume restoration, which doesn't scale and is error-prone. This approach doesn't ensure that ALL volumes restored from unencrypted snapshots are encrypted - it only encrypts volumes that are manually created with encryption specified. If someone forgets to specify encryption or uses a different method to restore volumes, they might remain unencrypted. Encryption by default ensures automatic encryption without manual steps.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nEBS encryption uses symmetric keys (AES-256), not asymmetric keys. AWS KMS supports both symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, but EBS volume encryption specifically requires symmetric CMKs. Asymmetric keys are used for different purposes like signing and encryption/decryption where the public and private keys serve different roles. EBS encryption uses symmetric encryption where the same key encrypts and decrypts data, providing the performance needed for block storage encryption.",

S3 Lifecycle policies can automatically transition objects from S3 Standard to Glacier Deep Archive after 30 days (or after 1 month as specified), reducing storage costs by up to 98% compared to S3 Standard. Glacier Deep Archive is designed for data that is accessed once or twice per year and provides the same durability as S3 Standard.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nS3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves objects between access tiers based on changing access patterns, but it's designed for data with unknown or unpredictable access patterns. Since the scenario clearly states that files are accessed frequently for 1 month and then not accessed afterward, the access pattern is predictable. Intelligent-Tiering has a monthly monitoring and automation fee per object, which can make it more expensive than a simple Lifecycle policy for data with predictable access patterns. For this use case with a clear access pattern, a Lifecycle policy is more cost-effective.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nS3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) is designed for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. However, Standard-IA is still more expensive than Glacier Deep Archive for long-term archival storage. Since the files are not accessed after 1 month and must be kept indefinitely, Standard-IA doesn't provide the same cost savings as Glacier Deep Archive.

While One Zone-IA is cheaper than Standard-IA, it's still more expensive than Glacier Deep Archive for long-term storage.

Cost Explorer can show cost trends over time, making it easy to identify when instance types changed and correlate that with cost increases.

While Budgets can track costs by instance type, it's primarily focused on budget management and alerts, not on detailed cost analysis and comparison. Budgets doesn't provide the same level of granular filtering and graph creation capabilities that Cost Explorer offers.

The first Lambda function receives information from API Gateway and places it in an SQS queue, then returns immediately. The second Lambda function processes messages from the queue and writes to Aurora PostgreSQL at its own pace. This architecture allows the API Gateway-facing Lambda to handle high volumes without being bottlenecked by database write operations. SQS provides buffering and automatic retry, and the second Lambda can scale independently based on queue depth. This decoupled design improves scalability with minimal configuration effort.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nRefactoring from Lambda to Apache Tomcat on EC2 requires significant code changes, infrastructure management, and configuration effort. You would need to provision and manage EC2 instances, configure Auto Scaling, handle patching and security updates, and manage the application server. This approach increases operational overhead significantly and doesn't minimize configuration effort. Additionally, EC2-based solutions don't automatically scale like Lambda and may not handle traffic spikes as effectively.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nChanging from Aurora PostgreSQL to DynamoDB requires significant application changes, as DynamoDB is a NoSQL database with a completely different data model and API compared to PostgreSQL. This would require rewriting database queries, changing the data model, and potentially losing relational database features. The migration effort would be substantial, and DynamoDB may not be suitable if the application relies on SQL features or complex queries. This doesn't minimize configuration effort.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nSimply setting up two Lambda functions without decoupling doesn't solve the scalability issue. If both functions are directly connected (one calling the other synchronously), you still have the same bottleneck problem. The key is using SQS to decouple the functions, allowing asynchronous processing and independent scaling. Without SQS, the second function would still need to process requests synchronously, maintaining the same scalability constraints.",

    "explanation": "**Why option A is correct:**\nAWS Config continuously monitors and records configuration changes to AWS resources, including S3 buckets. When you enable AWS Config with appropriate rules (like checking for public access, encryption settings, or bucket policies), it can detect unauthorized configuration changes and send notifications. Config maintains a complete configuration history, allowing you to see what changed, when it changed, and who made the change. Config rules can automatically evaluate configurations against desired settings and alert you to non-compliant changes, helping ensure S3 buckets don't have unauthorized configuration modifications.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nAWS Trusted Advisor provides best practice recommendations and checks for cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, and performance, but it doesn't monitor configuration changes in real-time. Trusted Advisor runs checks periodically and provides recommendations, but it doesn't track configuration history or send alerts when unauthorized changes occur. Trusted Advisor is more suited for identifying optimization opportunities rather than monitoring for unauthorized configuration changes.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nAmazon Inspector is a security assessment service that analyzes EC2 instances and container images for vulnerabilities and deviations from security best practices. It doesn't monitor S3 bucket configurations or track configuration changes. Inspector focuses on runtime security assessments of compute resources, not on monitoring resource configurations or detecting unauthorized changes to S3 bucket settings.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nAmazon S3 server access logging records access requests to S3 buckets (who accessed what objects and when), but it doesn't track configuration changes to the buckets themselves. Server access logging is for auditing object access, not for monitoring bucket configuration changes like bucket policies, encryption settings, or public access settings. To monitor configuration changes, you need AWS Config, not server access logging.",

    "explanation": "**Why option A is correct:**\nCloudWatch dashboards can be shared with specific email addresses without requiring the recipients to have AWS accounts. When you share a dashboard, you provide email addresses, and AWS sends invitation links. Each recipient creates their own password to access the dashboard, following the principle of least privilege by granting access only to view the specific dashboard, not the entire AWS account. This approach requires minimal operational overhead - just sharing the dashboard with the product manager's email address. The shared dashboard is read-only, so the product manager can view metrics but cannot make changes.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nCreating an IAM user for the product manager grants them AWS account access, which violates the principle of least privilege. An IAM user would have permissions beyond just viewing the CloudWatch dashboard - they could potentially access other AWS services depending on the policies attached. Additionally, creating IAM users adds operational overhead for user management, password policies, and access key rotation. Sharing a dashboard is simpler and more secure, as it only grants access to view that specific dashboard.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nCreating an IAM user for all company employees is overly broad and doesn't follow the principle of least privilege. This would grant AWS account access to multiple people when only the product manager needs dashboard access. Additionally, this approach doesn't address the requirement that the product manager doesn't have an AWS account - you would still need to create an account for them. Sharing a dashboard is more appropriate for granting limited, specific access.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nDeploying a bastion server in a public subnet is designed for secure remote access to private resources, not for sharing CloudWatch dashboards. A bastion server would require managing EC2 instances, security groups, and network configuration, adding significant operational overhead. This approach doesn't provide a way for the product manager to access the CloudWatch dashboard and is completely unrelated to the requirement. Dashboard sharing is the appropriate solution.",

    "explanation": "**Why option B is correct:**\nAWS SSO (now AWS IAM Identity Center) can be integrated with on-premises Active Directory through AWS Managed Microsoft AD. You enable AWS SSO, then configure it to use AWS Managed Microsoft AD, which can establish a trust relationship with your on-premises Active Directory. This allows users and groups managed in on-premises AD to authenticate to AWS SSO and access AWS accounts managed by AWS Organizations. Users continue to be managed in on-premises AD, and AWS SSO provides single sign-on access across all AWS accounts in the organization. This solution maintains centralized user management in on-premises AD while providing SSO across AWS accounts.\n\n**Why option A is incorrect:**\nThis option appears identical to option B, but there may be a subtle difference in the configuration approach. However, AWS SSO integrated with AWS Managed Microsoft AD (which trusts on-premises AD) is the correct solution for providing SSO across AWS accounts while maintaining user management in on-premises Active Directory. The key is establishing the trust relationship between AWS Managed Microsoft AD and on-premises AD.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nAWS Directory Service alone doesn't provide SSO across multiple AWS accounts. While AWS Managed Microsoft AD can be used for authentication, you need AWS SSO (IAM Identity Center) to provide single sign-on access across accounts in an AWS Organizations setup. Directory Service provides the directory infrastructure, but SSO provides the cross-account access management. Both are needed, but SSO is the component that enables access across accounts.\n\n**Why option D is incorrect:**\nDeploying an identity provider (IdP) on-premises would require significant infrastructure management and doesn't integrate as seamlessly with AWS SSO and AWS Organizations. While you could set up SAML federation with an on-premises IdP, AWS SSO with AWS Managed Microsoft AD provides a more integrated solution that works natively with AWS Organizations. The managed approach reduces operational overhead compared to deploying and managing your own IdP infrastructure.",

It provides automated failover between regions - if one region becomes unhealthy, traffic automatically routes to the next best region. Global Accelerator supports both TCP and UDP protocols, making it suitable for VoIP services that use UDP. The solution provides static IP addresses and deterministic routing, which is important for UDP-based applications.\n\n**Why option B is incorrect:**\nApplication Load Balancers operate at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) and are designed for HTTP-based applications. ALBs don't support UDP protocol, which is required for VoIP services. ALBs also don't provide cross-region routing or automated failover between regions - they operate within a single region. For UDP-based VoIP services that need cross-region routing and failover, you need Global Accelerator with Network Load Balancers.\n\n**Why option C is incorrect:**\nThis option appears identical to option A (NLB), but there may be a subtle difference. However, a Network Load Balancer alone doesn't provide cross-region routing or automated failover between regions - NLBs operate within a single region.

The more througput is needed, the more shards you add, the less throughput, the more shards you remove, so it's scalable. Each shard can handle up to 1MB/s of writes. However Kinesis data streams stores ingested data for only 1 to 7 days so there is a chance of data loss. Additionally, Kinesis data analytics and kinesis data streams are both for real-time ingestion and analytics. Firehouse on the other hand is also scalable and processes data in near real time as per the requirement. It also transfers data into Redshift which is a data warehouse so data won't be lost.
