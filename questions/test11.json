AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. With Fargate, you don't need to provision, configure, or manage servers. AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, allowing the company to focus solely on deploying and managing their containerized applications. This also inherently provides scalability and availability as Fargate automatically scales resources based on application needs.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis approach requires the company to manage the EC2 instances, including patching, scaling, and ensuring high availability. This contradicts the requirement of minimizing infrastructure management. While Docker provides containerization, it doesn't abstract away the underlying infrastructure management.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile Amazon ECS simplifies container orchestration compared to managing Docker directly on EC2, using Amazon EC2 worker nodes still requires the company to manage the EC2 instances. This includes tasks like patching, scaling the EC2 instances, and ensuring their availability. This contradicts the requirement of minimizing infrastructure management. The company wants to avoid managing the underlying infrastructure, which EC2 instances necessitate.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is designed to handle high-velocity, high-volume data streams, making it suitable for ingesting clickstream data from numerous sources. It allows for real-time processing and analysis of the data as it arrives, which is crucial for clickstream analysis. It also integrates well with other AWS services for further processing and storage.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because AWS Data Pipeline is primarily designed for batch processing and moving data between different AWS services. While it can archive data to S3, it's not the optimal solution for real-time or near real-time ingestion and processing of a high-volume, high-velocity data stream like clickstream data. It also doesn't address the initial data collection from the websites and applications.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because managing an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances for data processing would require significant operational overhead, including managing scaling, patching, and fault tolerance.

    "explanation": "**Why option 2 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the requirement by enabling multiple writer instances. Aurora Multi-Master allows for multiple instances to accept write operations concurrently. In the event of a failure of one writer instance, the other writer instances can continue to process write requests, ensuring continuous write availability. This eliminates the downtime associated with a traditional failover process where a reader is promoted to a writer.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nAdding a new AWS Region does not directly address the need for continuous write availability during an instance failover. While cross-region replication can provide disaster recovery capabilities, it doesn't eliminate the downtime associated with failing over to the secondary region. Furthermore, it introduces significant complexity and latency for write operations that need to be replicated across regions. This option is more suitable for disaster recovery and not for immediate failover for write operations.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nAdding a new reader in the same Availability Zone as the writer does not improve write availability. Readers are read-only replicas and cannot accept write operations. In the event of a writer instance failure, the reader instance would still need to be promoted to a writer, which involves a failover process and a period of downtime. This option only improves read scalability and availability, not write availability.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nEnabling parallel query in Aurora is designed to speed up complex analytical queries by distributing the workload across multiple nodes. It does not provide continuous write availability or address the requirement of maintaining write operations during an instance failover. Parallel query is a performance optimization feature for read operations, not a solution for high write availability.",

Scheduled scaling allows you to configure the Auto Scaling group to scale up to the desired compute level at 1 AM every night. This eliminates the gradual scaling process and ensures that the required capacity is available immediately when the batch job starts. After the batch job completes, the Auto Scaling group can scale down based on its scaling policies, optimizing costs.

This is not a cost-effective solution as it maintains a higher baseline capacity than required.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nIncreasing the maximum capacity for the Auto Scaling group only defines the upper limit of instances that can be launched. It doesn't address the slow scaling issue. The Auto Scaling group will still take time to reach the desired capacity, even if the maximum capacity is increased.

It is a highly available, scalable, and cost-effective solution. It also eliminates the need for ongoing management of NAT instances, directly addressing the problem statement. Gateway endpoints are free to use; you only pay for the DynamoDB usage itself. This makes it the most cost-effective option compared to other solutions that involve data transfer charges or more complex infrastructure.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because while a managed NAT gateway would provide connectivity to DynamoDB and reduce management overhead compared to NAT instances, it incurs data processing and hourly charges. Therefore, it is not the *most* cost-effective solution compared to a gateway VPC endpoint, which is free to use.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because establishing an AWS Direct Connect connection is significantly more expensive than other options. Direct Connect is generally used for hybrid cloud scenarios requiring high bandwidth and low latency to on-premises resources, not just for connecting to DynamoDB. It also involves significant setup and recurring costs, making it unsuitable for this scenario.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because AWS PrivateLink is designed for providing private connectivity to services hosted by other AWS accounts or third parties. While it can provide connectivity to DynamoDB, it's more complex and expensive than a gateway VPC endpoint for this specific use case.

The application can be designed to process messages from the paid tier queue first, ensuring that paid users' videos are converted before free tier users' videos. While standard queues do not guarantee strict FIFO, the probability of paid tier messages being processed before free tier messages is high if the paid tier queue is consistently polled before the free tier queue. This approach is generally more cost-effective than using FIFO queues because standard queues offer higher throughput and lower cost per message.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nUsing one FIFO queue for the paid tier and one standard queue for the free tier is not the most cost-effective solution. While the FIFO queue guarantees order for paid users, it introduces unnecessary complexity and cost compared to using two standard queues.

You would need to set up a separate system to analyze the mirrored traffic and then take action to filter the original traffic, making it a more complex and less direct solution than AWS Network Firewall. Also, mirroring alone doesn't block or filter traffic; it only copies it.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nAWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that allows you to centrally configure and manage firewall rules across multiple AWS accounts and VPCs. While it can be used to manage AWS Network Firewall rules, it doesn't directly provide the traffic inspection and filtering capabilities itself. It relies on services like AWS Network Firewall to enforce the rules. Therefore, it's not the primary service for implementing traffic inspection and filtering within a single VPC.",

The role provides temporary credentials that are automatically rotated, enhancing security.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because an IAM policy alone does not grant access.

The policy needs to be associated with the EC2 instances.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because IAM groups are designed to manage permissions for *users*, not EC2 instances. While you could create an IAM user for each EC2 instance and then add those users to a group, this is a less efficient and less secure approach than using IAM roles. It also creates unnecessary overhead in managing individual user accounts for each instance.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because creating an IAM user for each EC2 instance is not a best practice.

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThis is correct because an SQS queue provides a durable and reliable mechanism for decoupling the S3 upload event from the Lambda function invocation. When an image is uploaded to S3, an event can be sent to the SQS queue. The Lambda function can then be triggered by the SQS queue, processing messages (representing image uploads) at its own pace. This decoupling ensures that if the Lambda function is temporarily unavailable or encounters an error, the upload event is not lost and can be retried later, thus providing durability. It also allows the system to handle bursts of uploads without overwhelming the Lambda function.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because while the Lambda function will eventually process the messages in the SQS queue, this option alone doesn't establish the initial trigger for adding messages to the queue when an image is uploaded to S3. The Lambda function needs a trigger to start processing the queue, and this option doesn't define that trigger.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because Lambda functions are not designed to continuously monitor S3 buckets. While Lambda can be triggered by S3 events, directly monitoring an S3 bucket for new uploads is not a typical or efficient use case for Lambda. S3 event notifications are the preferred method.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because launching an EC2 instance to monitor an SQS queue introduces unnecessary complexity and cost. Lambda functions are designed to be triggered by SQS queues directly, eliminating the need for a separate EC2 instance. This option also violates the stateless requirement.\n\n**Why option 4 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because while EventBridge can monitor S3 events, it's not the best choice for ensuring durable processing in this scenario. EventBridge is suitable for routing events, but SQS provides a built-in retry mechanism and message buffering, making it more suitable for handling image processing tasks that might fail or experience temporary outages. Using EventBridge directly to trigger Lambda without SQS would mean that if the Lambda function fails, the event is lost unless additional error handling is implemented in EventBridge.",

The GWLB integrates seamlessly with VPC routing, allowing you to easily route traffic from the application VPC to the inspection VPC and back. This approach minimizes operational overhead because the GWLB handles the scaling and health checks of the firewall appliances, and it simplifies the routing configuration.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile a Network Load Balancer (NLB) can distribute traffic, it's not the ideal solution for integrating with a virtual firewall appliance. NLBs operate at Layer 4 and lack the features needed to efficiently manage and route traffic through the firewall. It would require more complex routing configurations and might not provide the same level of scalability and health checking as a GWLB. Also, NLBs are typically used for distributing traffic to backend instances, not for routing traffic through a separate VPC for inspection.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nAn Application Load Balancer (ALB) is designed for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and operates at Layer 7. While it can distribute traffic based on content, it's not the appropriate choice for integrating with a virtual firewall appliance that needs to inspect all traffic, regardless of the protocol.

    "explanation": "**Why option 3 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the requirement by leveraging Amazon S3 for static content hosting. S3 is highly scalable, durable, and cost-effective for serving static assets. By offloading the static content to S3, the application servers (if any) only need to handle the dynamic parts of the website, reducing their load and operational complexity. S3 integrates seamlessly with Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN), which can further improve latency by caching content closer to users globally. This combination provides high performance and scalability with minimal operational overhead, as S3 and CloudFront are managed services.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile S3 can host static websites, hosting the *full* website, including dynamic content, in different S3 buckets is not a practical or scalable solution for a dynamic ecommerce site. S3 is designed for static content, and serving dynamic content directly from S3 would require complex workarounds and would not provide the necessary performance or functionality for an ecommerce application. It also increases operational overhead due to the complexity of managing the dynamic content updates.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nDeploying the full website on Amazon EC2 instances in Auto Scaling groups can provide scalability, but it also introduces significant operational overhead. Managing EC2 instances, including patching, scaling, and monitoring, requires more effort than using managed services like S3 and CloudFront. While Auto Scaling helps with scaling, it doesn't eliminate the operational burden of managing the underlying infrastructure. Furthermore, EC2 instances are not as cost-effective for serving static content as S3 and CloudFront.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nMigrating the full application to run in containers (e.g., using ECS or EKS) can provide benefits like portability and scalability, but it also increases operational complexity compared to using S3 for static content. Containerization introduces the overhead of managing container orchestration platforms, building and deploying container images, and monitoring container health.

Snowball is designed for transferring large amounts of data in and out of AWS when network bandwidth is limited. The data is encrypted in transit and at rest within the Snowball device, meeting the security requirement. Export jobs directly support transferring data from S3 to Snowball.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nAWS Migration Hub primarily focuses on tracking application migrations and doesn't directly facilitate large-scale data transfer. Replication windows are not a core feature of Migration Hub. Even if it could be used for data transfer, 90 days is an unnecessarily long time for a quarterly audit requirement, and it doesn't directly address the low bandwidth constraint.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nAWS Storage Gateway volume gateway requires continuous network connectivity to synchronize data between on-premises and AWS.

The recent increase in Lambda's memory limit allows loading the 10GB of data into memory. Using a single API Gateway with path-based routing allows managing all models through a single entry point, simplifying management and reducing costs compared to having a separate API Gateway for each model. This approach provides high availability and low latency due to Lambda's inherent scaling capabilities and API Gateway's caching and routing features.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile Lambda can handle the memory requirements and sporadic usage, deploying a separate API Gateway for each model would significantly increase costs and management overhead. The question specifically asks for the MOST cost-effective solution, and managing hundreds of API Gateways is not cost-effective.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nECS requires instances to be running even when the models are not in use, leading to higher costs compared to Lambda, which can scale to zero.

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThis is correct because creating an Amazon RDS DB instance in Multi-AZ mode provides high availability by synchronously replicating data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone. In case of a failure of the primary instance, RDS automatically fails over to the standby instance, minimizing downtime and requiring no manual intervention. This directly addresses the high availability and minimal manual intervention requirements for the database component.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile creating an Amazon RDS DB instance with read replicas in another Availability Zone improves read performance and availability, it does not provide automatic failover for the primary database instance. Promoting a read replica to a standalone instance requires manual intervention, which violates the 'as little manual intervention as possible' requirement. Read replicas are primarily for scaling read operations, not for high availability of the primary write instance.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nCreating an Amazon EC2 instance-based Docker cluster requires significant manual effort for management, scaling, and patching of the EC2 instances. While it can provide high availability with proper configuration, it does not minimize manual intervention as much as a managed container service like ECS. This option also requires more operational overhead.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nCreating an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with a Fargate launch type is a good solution for the containerized application. Fargate removes the need to manage the underlying EC2 instances, reducing operational overhead and manual intervention. ECS with Fargate automatically handles scaling and availability of the containers, making it a highly available and managed solution. However, only one answer can be chosen for the container component.\n\n**Why option 4 is incorrect:**\nCreating an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with an Amazon EC2 launch type provides more control over the underlying infrastructure but requires more manual intervention for managing the EC2 instances. This includes patching, scaling, and ensuring high availability of the instances themselves.

Amazon ElastiCache is designed for in-memory caching, which can deliver sub-millisecond read performance. Since the company is willing to tolerate a small percentage of stale data, ElastiCache's eventual consistency model is acceptable. ElastiCache sits in front of the database and serves the most frequently accessed data directly from memory, significantly reducing the load on the database and improving read latency.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile read replicas can improve read performance by distributing read traffic across multiple database instances, they typically do not provide sub-millisecond response times. Read replicas still involve database operations, which are slower than in-memory caching. Also, read replicas are primarily for scaling read capacity and increasing availability, not necessarily for achieving the extreme low latency required in this scenario.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nIncreasing the instance size might improve database performance to some extent, but it's unlikely to achieve sub-millisecond response times consistently. A larger instance will have more memory and processing power, but it still involves disk I/O and database operations, which are inherently slower than in-memory caching. This option also doesn't address the requirement of tolerating stale data, which is a key indicator that caching is the preferred solution.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nAmazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) is designed for search and analytics workloads, not for caching database queries. While it can provide fast search results, it's not optimized for caching structured data from a SQL database and delivering sub-millisecond responses for common read requests.

A separate service (e.g., AWS Lambda) can then consume messages from SQS and process the files. This approach provides scalability to handle varying demand, as SQS can queue messages during peak periods. It also minimizes operational overhead because SQS and Lambda are managed services, reducing the need for manual server management and scaling.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nUsing Amazon EMR for this task is overkill. EMR is designed for large-scale data processing and analytics, typically involving large datasets and complex transformations. For small files and simple transformations, EMR introduces unnecessary complexity and operational overhead. Configuring and managing an EMR cluster requires significant effort, and the startup time for EMR jobs can be substantial, which doesn't align with the requirement for immediate processing.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile this option mentions S3 event notification and SQS, it is incomplete.

If the visibility timeout expires before the Lambda function completes, SQS will make the message available again, potentially triggering another invocation of the Lambda function. Increasing the visibility timeout to a value greater than the maximum execution time of the Lambda function ensures that the message remains invisible to other consumers (including Lambda) until the function has finished processing it, thus preventing duplicate processing. This approach has minimal operational overhead as it only involves changing a configuration setting in SQS.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nSetting up long polling in SQS will reduce the number of empty responses when the queue is polled, potentially reducing costs and improving efficiency. However, it does not prevent duplicate processing of messages if the visibility timeout is too short. The Lambda function could still be invoked multiple times for the same message if the initial invocation takes longer than the visibility timeout, regardless of whether long polling is enabled. Therefore, this option does not directly address the problem of duplicate emails.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nChanging the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue would prevent duplicate processing, as FIFO queues guarantee exactly-once processing.

    "explanation": "**Why option 2 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the requirements by leveraging AWS KMS for encryption and decryption. AWS KMS provides a managed, highly available, and secure service for managing encryption keys. Using a customer managed key gives the company control over the key lifecycle. The EC2 instance can use the AWS SDK to call KMS to encrypt and decrypt the certificates in near real-time. The encrypted data can then be stored in a highly available storage service like Amazon S3 or EBS. This approach minimizes operational overhead because AWS manages the underlying infrastructure and security of the KMS service.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile AWS Secrets Manager can store secrets, it's primarily designed for managing and rotating credentials, not for general-purpose encryption and decryption of large files like certificates. Using Secrets Manager for this purpose would likely involve storing the entire certificate as a secret, which might exceed size limits and could be less efficient than using KMS directly. Furthermore, while Secrets Manager provides encryption at rest, it doesn't directly facilitate the near real-time encryption/decryption required by the application. It also doesn't directly address the requirement of storing the data in highly available storage after encryption; that would need to be handled separately.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile using a Lambda function with the Python cryptography library could achieve encryption and decryption, it introduces significant operational overhead. The company would need to manage the Lambda function, including its code, dependencies, scaling, and security.

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThis is the correct solution because NAT gateways allow instances in private subnets to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing the internet from initiating inbound connections to those instances. Placing a NAT gateway in each public subnet ensures high availability, as instances in the corresponding private subnet can use the NAT gateway in their AZ for internet access. This approach aligns with AWS best practices for providing internet access to private subnets while maintaining security and high availability.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nUsing NAT instances is a valid approach, but it requires more management overhead than NAT gateways. NAT instances need to be patched, scaled, and managed for high availability. While possible, NAT gateways are the preferred and recommended solution by AWS due to their managed nature and inherent high availability when deployed correctly. The question implies a need for a highly available and managed solution, making NAT instances less suitable.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nInternet Gateways are designed to be attached to VPCs and provide a route for traffic to and from the internet. Attaching an Internet Gateway to a private subnet would effectively make it a public subnet, defeating the purpose of having private subnets. This would expose the instances in the private subnet directly to the internet, which is undesirable for security reasons.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nEgress-Only Internet Gateways are designed for IPv6 traffic only. They allow instances in a VPC to initiate outbound connections over IPv6 to the internet but prevent the internet from initiating inbound connections.

This allows the EC2 instance to mount and utilize the EFS file system for storing the SFTP server's data.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because while AWS DataSync is a suitable tool for migrating data, it is not needed in this scenario. The on-premises SFTP server is being migrated to an EC2 instance in AWS. DataSync is typically used for transferring data between on-premises storage and AWS storage services, or between different AWS storage services. Since the SFTP server is being migrated to AWS, the data can be directly copied to the EFS volume once the EC2 instance is running.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because the requirement specifies that the data should be stored on an Amazon EFS file system, not an EBS volume.

By enabling job bookmarks, Glue can remember which data has already been processed in previous runs. When the job runs again, it will only process the new data that has been added to the S3 bucket since the last run. This prevents reprocessing of old data, improving efficiency and reducing processing time and costs.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because deleting data after processing, while preventing reprocessing, is not a practical solution. The data might be needed for historical analysis or other purposes. Deleting data would also make the ETL job destructive, rather than simply processing new data. It's generally better to preserve the data in its original location and only process the new additions.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because setting the NumberOfWorkers field to 1 only affects the parallelism of the job and does not prevent reprocessing of old data. Reducing the number of workers might even increase the overall processing time, as the job will be executed sequentially instead of in parallel. The number of workers is related to the compute resources allocated to the job, not the data being processed.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because FindMatches is a machine learning transform in AWS Glue used for de-duplication and record linkage.

Shield Advanced is specifically designed to protect against large and complex DDoS attacks, making it suitable for the scenario described.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile Amazon GuardDuty detects malicious activity and unauthorized behavior, it doesn't directly block attackers in the way required to mitigate a large-scale DDoS attack. GuardDuty primarily focuses on threat detection and alerting, rather than immediate mitigation. It identifies potential threats, but it requires additional configuration and integration with other services to automatically block attackers.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nWhile CloudFront can help cache static content and absorb some DDoS traffic, it's not a complete solution for mitigating large-scale DDoS attacks, especially those targeting dynamic content or the origin server directly. CloudFront primarily protects against volumetric attacks targeting the edge locations, but sophisticated attacks can still overwhelm the origin. It's a good practice to use CloudFront, but it's not sufficient on its own to meet the question's requirements.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nUsing a Lambda function to automatically add attacker IP addresses to VPC network ACLs or security groups is not a scalable or reliable solution for mitigating large-scale DDoS attacks. Network ACLs and security groups have limitations on the number of rules, and updating them frequently can introduce latency and impact performance. Furthermore, identifying and blocking thousands of IP addresses in real-time using Lambda and network ACLs is complex and prone to errors. This approach is not recommended for mitigating large-scale DDoS attacks.\n\n**Why option 4 is incorrect:**\nUsing EC2 Spot Instances in an Auto Scaling group with a target tracking scaling policy addresses scaling the application based on load, but it does not directly mitigate a DDoS attack. While scaling can help handle increased traffic, it doesn't prevent the attack from reaching the application and potentially causing performance issues or downtime.

    "explanation": "**Why option 2 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the requirements by horizontally scaling the web and application tiers. Auto Scaling groups automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand, effectively handling traffic spikes. Using an Application Load Balancer distributes traffic across multiple instances, preventing any single instance from becoming a bottleneck. This approach improves both performance and scalability, which are the core requirements of the problem.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nVertically scaling the application instance by using a larger EC2 instance might provide a temporary performance boost, but it does not address the underlying scalability issue. Vertical scaling has limitations, and eventually, a single instance will become a bottleneck again, especially during significant traffic spikes. It also doesn't provide high availability.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile scaling the persistence layer horizontally can improve database performance, introducing Oracle RAC on AWS is complex and expensive. The bottleneck is identified in the application tier, not the database tier. Addressing the application tier bottleneck directly is more efficient and cost-effective. Also, Oracle RAC is not always the best solution for scaling a database and might introduce more complexity than necessary.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the cheapest storage option for infrequently accessed data that needs to be retained for long periods. This directly addresses the cost-effectiveness requirement while ensuring the data is kept indefinitely.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves data between frequent and infrequent access tiers based on access patterns, it's designed for data with unpredictable access patterns. Since the access pattern is known (frequent for 1 month, then infrequent), using Intelligent-Tiering would be less cost-effective than directly transitioning to Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month. Intelligent-Tiering also has monitoring costs that would add to the overall expense.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nTransitioning to S3 Standard-IA would be less cost-effective than Glacier Deep Archive for data that is rarely accessed. S3 Standard-IA is designed for infrequently accessed data but still requires faster retrieval times than Glacier Deep Archive. Since the files are not accessed after 1 month, the lower storage cost of Glacier Deep Archive makes it a better choice.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nS3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single availability zone, making it less resilient than other S3 storage classes. While it's cheaper than S3 Standard-IA, it's still more expensive than Glacier Deep Archive. More importantly, it's not ideal for backup data where durability is a key concern.

Cost Explorer provides built-in visualizations and reporting capabilities, minimizing the operational overhead of creating custom reports or dashboards.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nAWS Budgets are primarily used for setting cost thresholds and receiving alerts when costs exceed those thresholds. While Budgets can provide a high-level overview of EC2 costs, they do not offer the granular filtering and analysis capabilities needed to identify the root cause of unwanted vertical scaling. Creating a budget report would not provide the in-depth analysis required, increasing operational overhead.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThe AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard provides a general overview of costs but lacks the granular filtering and analysis capabilities of Cost Explorer.

    "explanation": "**Why option 3 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the requirement by decoupling the API Gateway endpoint from the database write operation. The first Lambda function receives the information from API Gateway. This function can then place the data into a queue service like SQS. The second Lambda function is triggered by the queue and handles writing the data to the Aurora PostgreSQL database. This asynchronous approach allows the API Gateway endpoint to respond quickly without waiting for the database write to complete, improving scalability. SQS also provides buffering and retries, making the system more resilient. This approach also minimizes configuration effort as it leverages existing managed services (Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, Aurora) without requiring significant infrastructure changes.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nRefactoring the Lambda function to Apache Tomcat code running on Amazon EC2 introduces significant complexity and configuration overhead. It requires managing EC2 instances, configuring Tomcat, and handling scaling and availability. This contradicts the requirement to minimize configuration effort. Also, moving to EC2 doesn't inherently solve the database write bottleneck; it just shifts the execution environment.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nChanging the platform from Aurora to DynamoDB might improve write performance, but it requires a significant application rewrite and a change in the data model. Aurora PostgreSQL is a relational database, while DynamoDB is a NoSQL database. This change would likely involve substantial configuration and development effort, violating the requirement to minimize configuration effort. Furthermore, the question doesn't indicate that Aurora is the bottleneck, but rather the Lambda function's ability to handle the volume of writes.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

Also, stopping and starting an RDS instance can take a significant amount of time, adding to the overall testing time.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nUsing Auto Scaling with an RDS instance is not a standard practice.

Scaling the primary instance up and down is not a feature of RDS Auto Scaling. Even if it were possible, the overhead of scaling operations and the complexity of configuring the scaling policies would likely outweigh the cost savings, especially given the short duration of the testing period and the fact that the instance is idle otherwise. Furthermore, the question specifies that the compute and memory attributes should not be reduced during the test.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nThis option is incorrect because it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the scenario.",

You can create a rule that checks for the presence of specific tags on EC2 instances, RDS DB instances, and Redshift clusters. AWS Config automatically evaluates your resources against these rules and provides a report of non-compliant resources. This minimizes the effort of configuring and operating the check, as it's an automated, managed service.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because Cost Explorer is primarily used for analyzing and visualizing AWS costs. While Cost Explorer can use tags to filter and group costs, it doesn't inherently detect or report on resources that are not properly tagged. It requires existing tags to function effectively for cost allocation.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because writing API calls to check for proper tag allocation would require significant development and operational overhead. It would involve writing, deploying, and maintaining custom code to iterate through all resources and verify their tags.

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nHosting a static website on Amazon S3 is highly cost-effective because S3 offers low storage costs and charges only for the data stored and the data transferred out. It eliminates the need to manage servers, operating systems, or web server software, reducing operational overhead and associated costs. Furthermore, S3's pay-as-you-go pricing model aligns well with the usage patterns of a website accessed by other teams, making it a cost-optimized solution for static content delivery.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nContainerizing the website and hosting it in AWS Fargate, while a viable solution, involves running containers, which incurs costs for compute resources (vCPU and memory) even if the website has low traffic. This is generally more expensive than hosting static content directly on S3, especially for a simple website with static assets. Fargate is better suited for dynamic applications or microservices.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nDeploying a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance to host the website requires managing the EC2 instance, including patching, security updates, and web server configuration. This incurs costs for the EC2 instance itself, as well as the operational overhead of managing the server. This is significantly more expensive than hosting static content on S3, which requires minimal management.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nConfiguring an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with an AWS Lambda target using Express.js is an overly complex and expensive solution for hosting static website content. Lambda is designed for event-driven, serverless compute, and using it to serve static assets adds unnecessary overhead and cost. The ALB also adds to the cost.

Kinesis Data Streams is designed for high-throughput, scalable streaming data ingestion. It allows for custom processing of the data, which can be used to remove sensitive information before storing it in a document database. The processed data can then be shared with other internal applications. Kinesis Data Streams provides the necessary infrastructure to handle the volume of transactions and the near real-time processing requirement.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nStoring the raw transactions directly into DynamoDB does not address the requirement of removing sensitive data before storage. While DynamoDB offers low-latency retrieval, it doesn't provide built-in data transformation capabilities. Furthermore, directly storing millions of transactions into DynamoDB without any processing or streaming mechanism might impact performance and scalability.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile 'Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data' sounds plausible, it's not specific enough. Kinesis Data encompasses several services, including Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, and Kinesis Data Analytics. Kinesis Data Streams is the most appropriate choice for this scenario because it allows for custom processing of the data before storage, which is crucial for removing sensitive information.

Kinesis Data Firehose provides a reliable and scalable way to ingest streaming data. By using Amazon Redshift as the destination, the data science team can query the ingested data in near-real-time using SQL. Kinesis Data Firehose also handles data buffering and retry mechanisms, minimizing data loss during EC2 instance reboots.

The 1 MB/s ingestion rate is well within the capabilities of Kinesis Data Firehose.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile Kinesis Data Streams can handle the ingestion rate and provide near-real-time data processing, it doesn't directly provide a querying capability. Kinesis Data Streams requires a consumer application to process the data, and the data science team would still need a separate data store and querying mechanism.

Simply pushing data to Kinesis is not a complete solution. A Kinesis Data Stream needs to be consumed by a Kinesis Data Analytics application or a custom consumer to process the data and store it in a database. The original option is better because it implies that the data will be processed and stored.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nAmazon SNS is a publish/subscribe messaging service that is suitable for broadcasting messages to multiple subscribers.

    "explanation": "**Why option 3 is correct:**\nThis is correct because AWS Storage Gateway's File Gateway allows on-premises applications to store files as objects in Amazon S3 while maintaining local, low-latency access to frequently used data. It supports standard file protocols like NFS and SMB, enabling users to mount the file share as a drive on their desktops. File Gateway can also integrate with Active Directory for user authentication and authorization, fulfilling all the requirements of the scenario.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because AWS S3 Glacier is an archive storage service for infrequently accessed data. It is not designed for mounting as a drive and does not support Active Directory integration for authentication.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because AWS DataSync is a data transfer service used to move data between on-premises storage and AWS storage services. It does not provide a mountable file share or Active Directory integration for user authentication.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nThis is incorrect because AWS Snowball Edge is a physical device used to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS. While it can provide local storage and compute, it's primarily designed for data migration and edge computing scenarios, not for providing a continuously available, mountable file share with Active Directory integration.",

    "correctAnswers": [
      1
    ],
    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the problem directly. Even with IPv6 enabled, AWS requires an IPv4 CIDR block for the VPC and its subnets. The error message indicates that the existing IPv4 subnet has run out of addresses. Creating a new IPv4 subnet with a larger CIDR block provides more IPv4 addresses, allowing the instance to be launched. This approach doesn't disrupt existing IPv6 functionality and resolves the immediate issue.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nChecking if only IPv6 was used during VPC creation is irrelevant. AWS VPCs, by default, require an IPv4 CIDR block, even when IPv6 is enabled. The problem is not about whether IPv6 was used, but about the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses in the existing subnet. This option doesn't address the root cause of the problem.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nCreating a new IPv6-only subnet doesn't solve the problem. While the VPC has IPv6 enabled, AWS still requires an IPv4 CIDR block for the VPC and its subnets. The error message indicates that the existing IPv4 subnet has run out of addresses, so creating an IPv6-only subnet will not resolve the IPv4 address exhaustion issue. The instance still needs an IPv4 address to be launched, even if it primarily uses IPv6.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nDisabling the IPv4 subnet and migrating all instances to IPv6 only is not a practical or immediately feasible solution. While migrating to IPv6-only might be a long-term goal, it's a complex undertaking that requires significant planning and effort. Moreover, many AWS services and applications still rely on IPv4. Disabling the IPv4 subnet without proper migration would likely break existing applications and services. The immediate problem is the inability to launch a new instance, and this option doesn't provide a quick or easy solution.",

    "correctAnswers": [

    ],
    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the requirement by providing a web application firewall (WAF) that can be associated with the Application Load Balancer (ALB). AWS WAF allows you to define rules to filter traffic based on various criteria, including IP addresses, HTTP headers, and request body. Configuring a rate-limiting rule allows you to limit the number of requests from a specific IP address within a defined time period. This effectively mitigates DDoS attacks and blocks illegitimate requests while minimizing the impact on legitimate users by only limiting requests from offending IP addresses.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nAmazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that automates security assessments. It helps identify security vulnerabilities and deviations from security best practices within your AWS environment. While important for overall security, it doesn't directly address the immediate need to block illegitimate incoming requests and mitigate DDoS attacks. It won't block traffic or provide rate limiting.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nNetwork ACLs (NACLs) provide stateless packet filtering at the subnet level. While NACLs can block traffic based on IP addresses, they are not well-suited for blocking traffic from a large number of rapidly changing IP addresses. Managing a large number of NACL rules can be complex and error-prone. Also, NACLs are stateless, meaning they don't track connections, making rate limiting difficult. This option would also likely impact legitimate users due to the difficulty of maintaining accurate and granular blocking rules.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nAmazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors your AWS accounts and workloads for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. While GuardDuty can detect potential DDoS attacks, it doesn't directly block or mitigate them. It primarily provides alerts and findings, requiring you to take separate action to block the traffic. GuardDuty does not have a built-in rate-limiting protection feature.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nThis solution addresses the requirements by leveraging Spot Instances for cost savings and Amazon EKS managed nodes to reduce operational overhead. Spot Instances offer significant discounts compared to On-Demand Instances, making them ideal for cost-sensitive applications. EKS managed nodes abstract away the complexities of managing the underlying infrastructure for the Kubernetes cluster, further reducing operational burden. The application's stateless nature and tolerance for disruptions align well with the characteristics of Spot Instances, as interruptions can be handled gracefully without significant impact.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nWhile using Spot Instances in an EC2 Auto Scaling group can reduce costs, it requires more manual configuration and management compared to using a managed Kubernetes service like EKS. Managing the container orchestration and scaling within the EC2 Auto Scaling group adds operational overhead that the question aims to minimize. It doesn't provide the container orchestration benefits of EKS.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nOn-Demand Instances are more expensive than Spot Instances. Using them would not meet the requirement of minimizing cost. While they offer more reliability, the application is tolerant of disruptions, making the higher cost of On-Demand Instances unnecessary.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nOn-Demand Instances are more expensive than Spot Instances. Using them would not meet the requirement of minimizing cost. While EKS managed nodes reduce operational overhead, the cost factor makes this option less suitable than using Spot Instances.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 0 is correct:**\nThis is correct because migrating the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora significantly reduces operational overhead. Aurora handles tasks like patching, backups, and replication automatically, freeing up the company's resources. Aurora also simplifies capacity planning by allowing the company to easily scale the database up or down as needed, without the need for manual provisioning and configuration of hardware.\n\n**Why option 1 is incorrect:**\nWhile migrating the web application to EC2 instances would move the application to the cloud, it doesn't inherently reduce operational overhead related to the web application layer. The company would still be responsible for managing the EC2 instances, including patching, scaling, and ensuring high availability. This doesn't directly address the core problem of reducing operational burden.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nSetting up an Amazon CloudFront distribution would improve the performance and availability of the web application by caching static content closer to users. However, it does not directly address the operational overhead and capacity planning issues related to the underlying infrastructure. CloudFront is primarily focused on content delivery, not infrastructure management.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nSetting up Amazon ElastiCache between the web application and the PostgreSQL database would improve the application's performance by caching frequently accessed data. However, it does not directly address the operational overhead and capacity planning issues related to the database infrastructure. While ElastiCache can reduce the load on the database, it doesn't eliminate the need for database management and scaling.\n\n**Why option 4 is incorrect:**\nMigrating the web application to AWS Fargate with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a good choice to reduce operational overhead for the web application layer. Fargate eliminates the need to manage the underlying EC2 instances, allowing the company to focus on the application itself. Capacity planning is also simplified, as Fargate automatically scales the application based on demand. However, the question asks for *two* actions, and migrating the database is also essential.",

    "explanation": "**Why option 1 is correct:**\nThis solution is appropriate because target tracking scaling policies are designed to maintain a specific metric at a target value. In this case, the target metric is CPU utilization, and the target value is 40%. The Auto Scaling group will automatically adjust the number of instances to keep the average CPU utilization of the group as close as possible to the specified target. This is the most effective way to maintain the desired performance across all instances.\n\n**Why option 0 is incorrect:**\nSimple scaling policies scale based on a threshold being breached. While they can be used for CPU utilization, they require defining specific thresholds and scaling adjustments (e.g., add 2 instances when CPU exceeds 80%). They don't automatically maintain a target value like 40%. This requires more manual configuration and is less adaptive than target tracking.\n\n**Why option 2 is incorrect:**\nUsing a Lambda function to update the desired capacity is a valid approach, but it introduces unnecessary complexity. It requires writing and maintaining custom code to monitor CPU utilization and adjust the Auto Scaling group's desired capacity. Target tracking policies provide a built-in, managed solution for this specific use case, making it a simpler and more efficient option.\n\n**Why option 3 is incorrect:**\nScheduled scaling actions scale the Auto Scaling group based on a predefined schedule. This approach is suitable for predictable traffic patterns, but it's not effective for maintaining a specific CPU utilization target. CPU utilization can fluctuate based on various factors, and a scheduled approach won't dynamically adapt to these changes.
